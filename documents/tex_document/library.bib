abstract = {The main physiological function of mitotic kinetochores is to provide durable attachment to spindle microtubules, which segregate chromosomes in order to partition them equally between the two daughter cells. Numerous kinetochore components that can bind directly to microtubules have been identified, including ATP-dependent motors and various microtubule-associated proteins with no motor activity. A major challenge facing the field is to explain chromosome motions based on the biochemical and structural properties of these individual kinetochore components and their assemblies. This chapter reviews the molecular mechanisms responsible for the motions associated with dynamic microtubule tips at the single-molecule level, as well as the activities of multimolecular ensembles called couplers. These couplers enable persistent kinetochore motion even under load, but their exact composition and structure remain unknown. Because no natural or artificial macro-machines function in an analogous manner to these molecular nano-devices, understanding their underlying biophysical mechanisms will require conceptual advances.},

abstract = {The spindle midzone—composed of antiparallel microtubules, microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), and motors—is the structure responsible for microtubule organization and sliding during anaphase B. In general, MAPs and motors stabilize the midzone and motors produce sliding. We show that fission yeast kinesin-6 motor klp9p binds to the microtubule antiparallel bundler ase1p at the midzone at anaphase B onset. This interaction depends upon the phosphorylation states of klp9p and ase1p. The cyclin-dependent kinase cdc2p phosphorylates and its antagonist phosphatase clp1p dephosphorylates klp9p and ase1p to control the position and timing of klp9p-ase1p interaction. Failure of klp9p-ase1p binding leads to decreased spindle elongation velocity. The ase1p-mediated recruitment of klp9p to the midzone accelerates pole separation, as suggested by computer simulation. Our findings indicate that a phosphorylation switch controls the spatial-temporal interactions of motors and MAPs for proper anaphase B, and suggest a mechanism whereby a specific motor-MAP conformation enables efficient microtubule sliding.},

abstract = {During mitosis, equal segregation of chromosomes depends on proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Merotelic kinetochore orientation, in which a single kinetochore binds microtubules from both spindle poles [1], is a major cause of chromosome instability [2], which is commonly observed in solid tumors [3, 4]. Using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we show that a proper force balance between kinesin motors on interpolar spindle microtubules is critical for correcting merotelic attachments. Inhibition of the plus-end-directed spindle elongation motors kinesin-5 (Cut7) and kinesin-6 (Klp9) reduces spindle length, tension at kinetochores, and the frequency of merotelic attachments. In contrast, merotely is increased by deletion of the minus-end-directed kinesin-14 (Klp2) or overexpression of Klp9. Also, Cdk1 regulates spindle elongation forces to promote merotelic correction by phosphorylating and inhibiting Klp9. The role of spindle elongation motors in merotelic correction is conserved, because partial inhibition of the human kinesin-5 homolog Eg5 using the drug monastrol reduces spindle length and lagging chromosome frequency in both normal (RPE-1) and tumor (CaCo-2) cells. These findings reveal unexpected links between spindle forces and correction of merotelic attachments and show that pharmacological manipulation of spindle elongation forces might be used to reduce chromosome instability in cancer cells.},

abstract = {The Ndc80 outer kinetochore complex plays a critical role in kinetochore-microtubule attachment, yet our understanding of the mechanism by which this complex interacts with spindle microtubules for timely and accurate chromosome segregation remains limited. Here we address this issue using an ndc80 mutant (ndc80-NH12) from fission yeast that contains a point mutation within a ubiquitous internal loop. This mutant is normal for assembly of the Ndc80 complex and bipolar spindle formation yet defective in proper end-on attachment to the spindle microtubule, with chromosome alignment defects and missegregation happening later during mitosis. We find that ndc80-NH12 exhibits impaired localization of the microtubule-associated protein complex Alp7/transforming acidic coiled coil (TACC)-Alp14/tumor-overexpressed gene (TOG) to the mitotic kinetochore. Consistently, wild-type Ndc80 binds these two proteins, whereas the Ndc80-NH12 mutant protein displays a substantial reduction of interaction. Crucially, forced targeting of Alp7-Alp14 to the outer kinetochore rescues ndc80-NH12-mutant phenotypes. The loop was previously shown to bind Dis1/TOG, by which it ensures initial chromosome capture during early mitosis. Strikingly, ndc80-NH12 is normal in Dis1 localization. Genetic results indicate that the loop recruits Dis1/TOG and Alp7/TACC-Alp14/TOG independently. Our work therefore establishes that the Ndc80 loop plays sequential roles in spindle-kinetochore attachment by connecting the Ndc80 complex to Dis1/TOG and Alp7/TACC-Alp14/TOG. {\textcopyright} 2013 Tang et al.},

abstract = {Peripheral microtubules (MTs) near the cell cortex are essential for the positioning and continuous constriction of the contractile ring (CR) in cytokinesis. Time-lapse observations of Drosophila male meiosis showed that myosin II was first recruited along the cell cortex independent of MTs. Then, shortly after peripheral MTs made contact with the equatorial cortex, myosin II was concentrated there in a narrow band. After MT contact, anillin and F-actin abruptly appeared on the equatorial cortex, simultaneously with myosin accumulation. We found that the accumulation of myosin did not require centralspindlin, but was instead dependent on Orbit, a Drosophila ortholog of the MT plus-end tracking protein CLASP. This protein is required for stabilization of central spindle MTs, which are essential for cytokinesis. Orbit was also localized in a mid-zone of peripheral MTs, and was concentrated in a ring at the equatorial cortex during late anaphase. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments indicated that Orbit is closely associated with F-actin in the CR. We also showed that the myosin heavy chain was in close proximity with Orbit in the cleavage furrow region. Centralspindlin was dispensable in Orbit ring formation. Instead, the Polo-KLP3A/Feo complex was required for the Orbit accumulation independently of the Orbit MT-binding domain. However, orbit mutations of consensus sites for the phosphorylation of Cdk1 or Polo did not influence the Orbit accumulation, suggesting an indirect regulatory role of these protein kinases in Orbit localization. Orbit was also necessary for the maintenance of the CR. Our data suggest that Orbit plays an essential role as a connector between MTs and the CR in Drosophila male meiosis. {\textcopyright} 2014 Kitazawa et al.},

abstract = {The nuclear import of classical nuclear localization signal-containing proteins depends on importin-$\alpha$ transport receptors. In budding yeast there is a single importin-$\alpha$ gene and in higher eukaryotes there are multiple importin-$\alpha$-like genes, but in fission yeast there are two: the previously characterized cut15 and the more recently identified imp1. Like other importin-$\alpha$ family members, Imp1p supports nuclear protein import in vitro. In contrast to cut15, imp1 is not essential for viability, but imp1$\Delta$ mutant cells exhibit a telophase delay and mild temperature-sensitive lethality. Differences in the cellular functions that depend on Imp1p and Cut15p indicate that they each have unique physiological roles. They also have common roles because the imp1$\Delta$ and the cut15-85 temperature-sensitive mutations are synthetically lethal; overexpression of cut15 partially suppresses the temperature sensitivity, but not the mitotic delay in imp1$\Delta$ cells; and overexpression of imp1 partially suppresses the mitotic defect in cut15-85 cells but not the loss of viability. Both Imp1p and Cut15p are required for the efficient nuclear import of both an SV40 nuclear localization signal-containing reporter protein and the Pap1p component of the stress response MAP kinase pathway. Imp1p and Cut15p are essential for efficient nuclear protein import in S. pombe. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Genetics Society of America.},

abstract = {Cell size is one of the critical parameters controlling the size of intracellular structures. A well-known example is the constant nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio (N/C ratio) [1-5]. The length of the metaphase spindle is proportional to cell size, but it has an upper limit during early embryogenesis [6]. During anaphase, the mitotic spindle elongates and delivers the centrosomes and sister chromatids near the centers of the nascent daughter cells. Here, we quantified the relationship between spindle elongation and cell size in the early embryo of Caenorhabditis elegans and propose possible models for cell-size-dependent spindle elongation. Quantitative measurements revealed that the extent and speed of spindle elongation are correlated with cell size throughout early embryogenesis. RNAi knockdown of G$\alpha$ proteins and their regulators revealed that the spindles failed to fully elongate and that the speed of spindle elongation was almost constant regardless of cell size. Our results suggest that spindle elongation is controlled by two qualitatively distinct mechanisms, i.e., G$\alpha$-dependent and -independent modes of elongation. Simulation analyses revealed that the constant-pulling model and the force-generator-limited model reproduced the dynamics of the G$\alpha$-independent and G$\alpha$-dependent mechanisms, respectively. These models also explain how the set length of spindles is achieved. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Many +TIPs have affinity for each other but the functional significance of these associations is unclear. Here we investigate the physical and functional interactions among three +TIPs in S. cerevisiae, Stu2, Bik1 Bim1. Two-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and in vitro binding assays demonstrate that they associate in all pairwise combinations, although the interaction between Stu2 and Bim1 may be indirect. Three-hybrid assays indicate that these proteins compete for binding to each other. Thus, Stu2, Bik1, and Bim1 interact physically but do not appear to be arranged in a single unique complex. We examined the functional interactions among pairs of proteins by comparing cytoplasmic and spindle microtubule dynamics in cells lacking either one or both proteins. On cytoplasmic microtubules, Stu2 and Bim1 act cooperatively to regulate dynamics in G1 but not in preanaphase, whereas Bik1 acts independently from Stu2 and Bim1. On kinetochore microtubules, Bik1 and Bim1 are redundant for regulating dynamics, whereas Stu2 acts independently from Bik1 and Bim1. These results indicate that interactions among +TIPS can play important roles in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The American Society for Cell Biology.},

abstract = {During mitosis the spindle undergoes considerable morphological and dynamic changes. Particularly the central spindle reorganizes drastically at the onset of anaphase when the antiparallel microtubule bundler PRC1 starts to accumulate and recruit a subset of spindle proteins to the midzone. Little is known about how the dynamic properties of the central spindle change during its morphological changes in human cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we generated human RPE1 cells that express from their endogenous locus fluorescently tagged versions of the two cytoskeletal network hub proteins PRC1 and the end binding protein EB1 to be able to quantify their spindle distribution and binding/unbinding turnover under native conditions. We find that throughout mitosis EB1 binds central spindle microtubule bundles in a PRC1-dependent manner using a binding mode different from EB1 at growing microtubule ends. Both proteins, PRC1 and EB1, progressively accumulate and bind increasingly strongly to compacting central antiparallel microtubule overlaps. These results show that the central spindle gradually 'solidifies' during mitosis, suggesting that the two protein interaction networks around PRC1 and EB1 cooperate to stabilize the shortening central spindle, explaining the importance of both proteins for correct chromosome segregation and cytokinesis.},

abstract = {An important question in cell biology is how cellular organelles partition during cell division. In organisms undergoing closed mitosis, the elongation of an intranuclear spindle drives nuclear division, generating two identically sized nuclei [1, 2]. However, how the site of nuclear division is determined and the underlying mechanism driving nuclear envelope (NE) fission remain largely unknown. Here, using the fission yeast, we show that the microtubule bundler Ase1/PRC1 at the spindle midzone is required for the local concentration of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in the region of the NE in contact with the central spindle. As the spindle elongates during anaphase B, components of these NPCs are sequentially eliminated, and this is accompanied by the local remodeling of the NE. These two events lead to the eventual removal of NPCs and nuclear division. In the absence of importin $\alpha$, NPCs remain stable in this region and no event of NE remodeling is observed. Consequently, cells fail to undergo nuclear division. Thus, our results highlight a new role of the central spindle as a spatial cue that determines the site of nuclear division and point to NPC removal as the triggering event.},

abstract = {The spindle midzone, a conspicuous network of antiparallel interdigitating nonkinetochore microtubules between separating chromosomes, plays a crucial role in regulating the initiation and completion of cytokinesis. In this study, we report the use of time-lapse microscopy and a human kinesin endoribonucleases RNase III-prepared short interfering RNA (esiRNA) library to identify Kif4 as a motor protein that translocates PRC1, a spindle midzone-associated cyclin-dependent kinase substrate protein, to the plus ends of interdigitating spindle microtubules during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. We show that Kif4 binds to PRC1 through its "stalk plus tail" domains and Kif4 and PRC1 colocalize on the spindle midzone/midbody during anaphase and cytokinesis. Suppression of Kif4 expression by Kif4 esiRNA results in the inhibition of PRC1 translocation, a block of the midzone formation, and a failure of cytokinesis. PRC1 translocation and midzone formation can be restored, and the cytokinetic defects can be rescued in Kif4 esiRNA-treated cells by coexpression of Kif4 but not its motor dead mutant Kif4md. Furthermore, we show that cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation of PRC1 controls the timing of PRC1 translocation by Kif4. These results, in light of the crucial role of PRC1 in midzone formation, indicate that cell cycle-dependent translocation of PRC1 by Kif4 is essential for midzone formation and cytokinesis.},

Here they have in vivo and biochemical evidence that the dephosphorilation of PRC1 allows for recruitment of kif4. This phosphorilation also keeps PRC1 in a monomeric state and free, so maybe not strictly related to the binding, but ultimately its the same.},

The ability to analyze ECM degradation can be valuable in the study of developmental processes as well as pathologies, such as cancer. In this unit we describe an in vitro live cell-based method to image and quantitatively measure the degradation of ECM components by live cells. Cells are grown in the presence of fluorescent dye-quenched protein substrates (DQ-gelatin, DQ-collagen I, and DQ-collagen IV) that are mixed with protein matrices. Upon proteolytic cleavage, fluorescence is released that directly reflects the level of proteolysis by the cells. Using confocal microscopy and advanced imaging software, the fluorescence is detected and accurate measurements of proteolytic degradation in three and four dimensions can be assessed.},

abstract = {The Frizzled receptor and Dishevelled effector regulate mitotic spindle orientation in both vertebrates and invertebrates, but how Dishevelled orients the mitotic spindle is unknown. Using the Drosophila S2 cell "induced polarity" system, we find that Dishevelled cortical polarity is sufficient to orient the spindle and that Dishevelled's DEP domain mediates this function. This domain binds a C-terminal domain of Mud (the Drosophila NuMA ortholog), and Mud is required for Dishevelled-mediated spindle orientation. In Drosophila, Frizzled-Dishevelled planar cell polarity (PCP) orients the sensory organ precursor (pI) spindle along the anterior-posterior axis. We show that Dishevelled and Mud colocalize at the posterior cortex of pI, Mud localization at the posterior cortex requires Dsh, and Mud loss-of-function randomizes spindle orientation. During zebrafish gastrulation, the Wnt11-Frizzled-Dishevelled PCP pathway orients spindles along the animal-vegetal axis, and reducing NuMA levels disrupts spindle orientation. Overall, we describe a Frizzled-Dishevelled-NuMA pathway that orients division from Drosophila to vertebrates.},

abstract = {Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an excellent model organism for the study of vertebrate development including skeletogenesis. Studies of mammalian cartilage formation were greatly advanced through the use of a cartilage specific regulatory element of the Collagen type II alpha 1 (Col2a1) gene. In an effort to isolate such an element in zebrafish, we compared the expression of two col2a1 homologues and found that expression of col2a1b, a previously uncharacterized zebrafish homologue, only partially overlaps with col2a1a. We focused our analysis on col2a1a, as it is expressed in both the stacked chondrocytes and the perichondrium. By comparing the genomic sequence surrounding the predicted transcriptional start site of col2a1a among several species of teleosts we identified a small highly conserved sequence (R2) located 1.7. kb upstream of the presumptive transcriptional initiation site. Interestingly, neither the sequence nor location of this element is conserved between teleost and mammalian Col2a1. We generated transient and stable transgenic lines with just the R2 element or the entire 1.7. kb fragment 5′ of the transcriptional initiation site. The identified regulatory elements enable the tracking of cellular development in various tissues by driving robust reporter expression in craniofacial cartilage, ear, notochord, floor plate, hypochord and fins in a pattern similar to the expression of endogenous col2a1a. Using a reporter gene driven by the R2 regulatory element, we analyzed the morphogenesis of the notochord sheath cells as they withdraw from the stack of initially uniform cells and encase the inflating vacuolated notochord cells. Finally, we show that like endogenous col2a1a, craniofacial expression of these reporter constructs depends on Sox9a transcription factor activity. At the same time, notochord expression is maintained after Sox9a knockdown, suggesting that other factors can activate expression through the identified regulatory element in this tissue. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, nanotubes represent a substantial fraction of transport intermediates between organelles. They are extracted from membranes by molecular motors walking along microtubules. We previously showed that kinesins fixed on giant unilamellar vesicles in contact with microtubules are sufficient to form nanotubes in vitro. Motors were attached to the membrane through beads, thus facilitating cooperative effects. Koster et al. proposed that motors could dynamically cluster at the tip of tubes when they are individually attached to the membrane. We demonstrate, in a recently designed experimental system, the existence of an accumulation of motors allowing tube extraction. We determine the motor density along a tube by using fluorescence intensity measurements. We also perform a theoretical analysis describing the dynamics of motors and tube growth. The only adjustable parameter is the motor binding rate onto microtubules, which we measure to be 4.7 +/- 2.4 s(-1). In addition, we quantitatively determine, for a given membrane tension, the existence of a threshold in motor density on the vesicle above which nanotubes can be formed. We find that the number of motors pulling a tube can range from four at threshold to a few tens away from it. The threshold in motor density (or in membrane tension at constant motor density) could be important for the understanding of membrane traffic regulation in cells.},

abstract = {Microtubule dynamics are regulated by plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs), which bind microtubule ends and influence their polymerization properties. In addition to binding microtubules, most +TIPs physically associate with other +TIPs, creating a complex web of interactions. To fully understand how +TIPs regulate microtubule dynamics, it is essential to know the intrinsic biochemical activities of each +TIP and how +TIP interactions affect these activities. Here, we describe the activities of Bim1 and Bik1, two +TIP proteins from budding yeast and members of the EB1 and CLIP-170 families, respectively. We find that purified Bim1 and Bik1 form homodimers that interact with each other to form a tetramer. Bim1 binds along the microtubule lattice but with highest affinity for the microtubule end; however, Bik1 requires Bim1 for localization to the microtubule lattice and end. In vitro microtubule polymerization assays show that Bim1 promotes microtubule assembly, primarily by decreasing the frequency of catastrophes. In contrast, Bik1 inhibits microtubule assembly by slowing growth and, consequently, promoting catastrophes. Interestingly, the Bim1-Bik1 complex affects microtubule dynamics in much the same way as Bim1 alone. These studies reveal new activities for EB1 and CLIP-170 family members and demonstrate how interactions between two +TIP proteins influence their activities. {\textcopyright} 2010 by The American Society for Cell Biology.},

abstract = {Mitotic segregation of chromosomes requires spindle pole functions for microtubule nucleation, minus end organization, and regulation of dynamics. $\gamma$-Tubulin is essential for nucleation, and we now extend its role to these latter processes. We have characterized a mutation in $\gamma$-tubulin that results in cold-sensitive mitotic arrest with an elongated bipolar spindle but impaired anaphase A. At 30°C cytoplasmic microtubule arrays are abnormal and bundle into single larger arrays. Three-dimensional time-lapse video microscopy reveals that microtubule dynamics are altered. Localization of the mutant $\gamma$-tubulin is like the wild-type protein. Prediction of $\gamma$-tubulin structure indicates that non-$\alpha$/$\beta$-tubulin protein-protein interactions could be affected. The kinesin-like protein (klp) Pkl1p localizes to the spindle poles and spindle and is essential for viability of the $\gamma$-tubulin mutant and in multicopy for normal cell morphology at 30°C. Localization and function of Pkl1p in the mutant appear unaltered, consistent with a redundant function for this protein in wild type. Our data indicate a broader role for $\gamma$- tubulin at spindle poles in regulating aspects of microtubule dynamics and organization. We propose that Pkl1p rescues an impaired function of $\gamma$- tubulin that involves non-tubulin protein-protein interactions, presumably with a second motor, MAP, or MTOC component.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. Drosophila melanogaster kinesin-14 Ncd cross-links parallel microtubules at the spindle poles and antiparallel microtubules within the spindle midzone to play roles in bipolar spindle assembly and proper chromosome distribution. As observed for Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinesin-14 Kar3Vik1 and Kar3Cik1, Ncd binds adjacent microtubule protofilaments in a novel microtubule binding configuration and uses an ATP-promoted powerstroke mechanism. The hypothesis tested here is that Kar3Vik1 and Kar3Cik1, as well as Ncd, use a common ATPase mechanism for force generation even though the microtubule interactions for both Ncd heads are modulated by nucleotide state. The presteady-state kinetics and computational modeling establish an ATPase mechanism for a powerstroke model of Ncd that is very similar to those determined for Kar3Vik1 and Kar3Cik1, although these heterodimers have one Kar3 catalytic motor domain and a Vik1/Cik1 partner motor homology domain whose interactions with microtubules are not modulated by nucleotide state but by strain. The results indicate that both Ncd motor heads bind the microtubule lattice; two ATP binding and hydrolysis events are required for each powerstroke; and a slow step occurs after microtubule collision and before the ATP-promoted powerstroke. Note that unlike conventional myosin-II or other processive molecular motors, Ncd requires two ATP turnovers rather than one for a single powerstroke-driven displacement or step. These results are significant because all metazoan kinesin-14s are homodimers, and the results presented show that despite their structural and functional differences, the heterodimeric and homodimeric kinesin-14s share a common evolutionary structural and mechanochemical mechanism for force generation.},

These attachments can result in improper chromosome segregation and are a significant source of aneuploidy [1, 2], a hallmark of cancer [3-5]. Aurora B kinase and the kinesin-13 microtubule depolymerase mitotic-centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK) are required to release improper microtubule attachments [6-9]. Aurora B regulates MCAK's activity and localization [10-12]. We set out to understand why MCAK and Aurora B are more abundant at some metaphase-aligned centromeres but are present at low amounts on most others. We found that members of the Aurora B complex are specifically enriched at merotelic attachment sites. We also found that Aurora B does not require its activity to become enriched at these sites; however, inhibition of Aurora B activity causes a significant increase in the number of merotelic attachments per cell. Aurora B activity enriches MCAK at merotelic attachments and phosphorylates MCAK on residues that regulate its microtubule depolymerase activity. These data demonstrate that proteins that resolve the defect are specifically localized to merotelic attachments, where their enzymatic activities are regulated. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We discuss a model of dynamic instability based on the popular idea that growth is maintained by a cap at the tip of the fiber. The loss of this cap is thought to trigger the transition from growth to shrinkage, called a catastrophe. The model includes longitudinal interactions between the terminal tubulins of each protofilament and "gating rescues" between neighboring protofilaments. These interactions allow individual protofilaments to transiently shorten during a phase of overall microtubule growth. The model reproduces the reported dependency of the catastrophe rate on tubulin concentration, the time between tubulin dilution and catastrophe, and the induction of microtubule catastrophes by walking depolymerases. The model also reproduces the comet tail distribution that is characteristic of proteins that bind to the tips of growing microtubules.},

To further investigate how spatially constrained actin nucleation determines the emergent actin organization, we performed detailed simulations of the actin filament system using Cytosim. We first calibrated the steric interaction between filaments, by matching, in simulations and experiments, the bundled actin organization observed with a rectangular bar of nucleating factor. We then studied the overall organization of actin filaments generated by more complex pattern geometries used experimentally. We found that the fraction of parallel versus antiparallel bundles is determined by the mechanical properties of actin filament or bundles and the efficiency of nucleation. Thus nucleation geometry, actin filaments local interactions, bundle rigidity, and nucleation efficiency are the key parameters controlling the emergent actin architecture. We finally simulated more complex nucleation patterns and performed the corresponding experiments to confirm the predictive capabilities of the model.},

It consists of two distinct processes: Anaphase A, the movement of chromosomes toward spindle poles via shortening of the connecting fibers, and anaphase B, separation of the two poles from one another via spindle elongation. I focus here on anaphase A chromosome-to-pole movement. The chapter begins by summarizing classical observations of chromosome movements, which support the current understanding of anaphase mechanisms. Live cell fluorescence microscopy studies showed that poleward chromosome movement is associated with disassembly of the kinetochore-attached microtubule fibers that link chromosomes to poles. Microtubule-marking techniques established that kinetochore-fiber disassembly often occurs through loss of tubulin subunits from the kinetochore-attached plus ends. In addition, kinetochore-fiber disassembly in many cells occurs partly through ‘flux', where the microtubules flow continuously toward the poles and tubulin subunits are lost from minus ends. Molecular mechanistic models for how load-bearing attachments are maintained to disassembling microtubule ends, and how the forces are generated to drive these disassembly-coupled movements, are discussed.},

abstract = {Eukaryotes segregate chromosomes in "open" or "closed" mitosis, depending on whether their nuclear envelopes (NEs) break down or remain intact. Here we show that the control of the nuclear surface area may determine the choice between these two modes. The dividing nucleus does not expand its surface in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, confining the mitotic spindle and causing it to buckle. The NE ruptures in anaphase, releasing the compressive stress and allowing chromosome segregation. Blocking the NE expansion in the related species Schizosaccharomyces pombe that undergoes closed mitosis induces spindle buckling and collapse in the absence of an intrinsic NE rupture mechanism. We propose that scaling considerations could have shaped the evolution of eukaryotic mitosis by necessitating either nuclear surface expansion or the NE breakdown. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Microtubule (MT) arrays are mechanistic effectors of polarity specification and cell division. Linear bundles in which MTs are bridged laterally are dynamically assembled in systems ranging from differentiated metazoan cells to fungi in a process that remains poorly understood. Often, bundled MTs slide with respect to each other via molecular motors. In interphase cells of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, MT nucleation frequently occurs at preexisting arrays. As the nascent MT lengthens, stable antiparallel MT overlaps are thought to form through competition between motion of the minus-end-directed kinesin Klp2p and braking force exerted by the accumulating lateral crosslinker Ase1p. Here we show that Mia1p/Alp7p, a transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC) protein, functions as a length-independent MT crosslinker. In cells lacking Mia1p MT-bundling activity, linear arrays frequently disassemble, accompanied by a marked increase in Ase1p off rate and erratic motion of sliding MTs. We propose that the combined action of lateral length-dependent (Ase1p) and terminal length-independent (Mia1p) crosslinkers is crucial for robust assembly and stability of linear MT arrays. Such use of qualitatively distinct crosslinking mechanisms in tandem may point to a general design principle in the engineering of stable cytoskeletal assemblies.},

abstract = {During spindle assembly, microtubules may attach to kinetochores or pair to form antiparallel pairs or interpolar microtubules, which span the two spindle poles and contribute to mitotic pole separation and chromosome segregation. Events in the specification of the interpolar microtubules are poorly understood. Using three-dimensional electron tomography and analysis of spindle dynamical behavior in living cells, we investigated the process of spindle assembly. Unexpectedly, we found that the phosphorylation state of an evolutionarily conserved Cdk1 site (S360) in $\gamma$-tubulin is correlated with the number and organization of interpolar microtubules. Mimicking S360 phosphorylation (S360D) results in bipolar spindles with a normal number of microtubules but lacking interpolar microtubules. Inhibiting S360 phosphorylation (S360A) results in spindles with interpolar microtubules and high-angle, antiparallel microtubule pairs. The latter are also detected in wild-type spindles {\textless}1 $\mu$m in length, suggesting that high-angle microtubule pairing represents an intermediate step in interpolar microtubule formation. Correlation of spindle architecture with dynamical behavior suggests that microtubule pairing is sufficient to separate the spindle poles, whereas interpolar microtubules maintain the velocity of pole displacement during early spindle assembly. Our findings suggest that the number of interpolar microtubules formed during spindle assembly is controlled in part through activities at the spindle poles. {\textcopyright} 2013 Nazarova et al.},

abstract = {Successful cell division requires proper chromosome segregation during anaphase. Forces required for chromosome segregation in human cells are linked to sliding of antiparallel microtubules and sliding capacity has been demonstrated in vitro for multiple motor proteins, but the molecular mechanism of sliding in the spindle of human cells remains unknown. Using combined depletion and inactivation assays to explore redundancy between multiple targets together with CRISPR technology, we found that PRC1-dependent motor KIF4A/kinesin-4, together with EG5/kinesin-5 motor is essential for spindle elongation in human cells. Photoactivation of tubulin and super-resolution microscopy show that perturbation of both proteins impairs sliding, while decreased midzone microtubule stability cannot explain the observed anaphase arrest. Thus, two independent sliding modules power sliding mechanism that drives spindle elongation in human cells.},

abstract = {Form and function of the mitotic spindle depend on motor proteins that crosslink microtubules and move them relative to each other. Among these are kinesin-14s, such as Ncd, which interact with one microtubule via their non-processive motor domains and with another via their diffusive tail domains, the latter allowing the protein to slip along the microtubule surface. Little is known about the influence of the tail domains on the protein's performance. Here, we show that diffusive anchorage of Ncd's tail domains impacts velocity and force considerably. Tail domain slippage reduced velocities from 270 nm s−1 to 60 nm s−1 and forces from several piconewtons to the sub-piconewton range. These findings challenge the notion that kinesin-14 may act as an antagonizer of other crosslinking motors, such as kinesin-5, during mitosis. It rather suggests a role of kinesin-14 as a flexible element, pliantly sliding and crosslinking microtubules to facilitate remodeling of the mitotic spindle.},

Although both spindle self-organization and actin-dependent cytokinesis have long been the subject of intense investigation, it has only recently become apparent that the actin cortex also has a key role during early mitosis. This is most striking in animal cells, in which changes in the actin cytoskeleton drive mitotic cell rounding and cortical stiffening. This mitotic cortex then functions as a foundation for spindle assembly and to guide spindle orientation with respect to extracellular chemical and mechanical cues. Here, we discuss this recent work and the possible role of crosstalk between the mitotic actin cortex and the plus ends of astral microtubules in this process.},

abstract = {Wnt11 is a key signal, determining cell polarization and migration during vertebrate gastrulation. It is known that Wnt11 functionally interacts with several signaling components, the homologues of which control planar cell polarity in Drosophila melanogaster. Although in D. melanogaster these components are thought to polarize cells by asymmetrically localizing at the plasma membrane, it is not yet clear whether their subcellular localization plays a similarly important role in vertebrates. We show that in zebrafish embryonic cells, Wnt11 locally functions at the plasma membrane by accumulating its receptor, Frizzled 7, on adjacent sites of cell contacts. Wnt11-induced Frizzled 7 accumulations recruit the intracellular Wnt signaling mediator Dishevelled, as well as Wnt11 itself, and locally increase cell contact persistence. This increase in cell contact persistence is mediated by the local interaction of Wnt11, Frizzled 7, and the atypical cadherin Flamingo at the plasma membrane, and it does not require the activity of further downstream effectors of Wnt11 signaling, such as RhoA and Rok2. We propose that Wnt11, by interacting with Frizzled 7 and Flamingo, modulates local cell contact persistence to coordinate cell movements during gastrulation.},

However, which physical parameters are important in governing the shape evolution of the NE, and how defects in the dividing chromosomes/microtubules are reflected in those parameters, are fundamental questions that remain unresolved. In this study, we show that improper separation of chromosomes in genetically deficient cells leads to membrane tethering or asymmetric division in contrast to the formation of two equal-sized daughter nuclei in wild-type cells. We hypothesize that the poleward force is transmitted to the nuclear membrane through its physical contact with the separated sister chromatids at the two spindle poles. A theoretical model is developed to predict the morphology evolution of the NE where key factors such as the work done by the poleward force and bending and surface energies stored in the membrane have been taken into account. Interestingly, the predicted phase diagram, summarizing the dependence of nuclear shape on the size of the load transmission regions, and the pole-to-pole distance versus surface area relationship all quantitatively agree well with our experimental observations, suggesting that this model captures the essential physics involved in closed mitosis.},

Many associated factors help organize the spindle, including molecular motors and regulators of microtubule dynamics.

abstract = {Chromosomes attach to the mitotic spindle via their kinetochores. The average number of spindle microtubules binding to each kinetochore varies with species, the stage of mitosis, and the length of time that the kinetochore has been attached to the spindle. In this report, we investigate how kinetochore microtubule number varies with kinetochore size and chromosome size in PtK1 cells. From an analysis of serial-section electron micrographs, we determined that the average surface area of metaphase, taxol-treated metaphase, and anaphase kinetochores is 0.16 ± 0.05 $\mu$m2 (N = 181). Surprisingly, kinetochore microtubules are packed more densely on the smaller kinetochores, as seen by a reduction in the average spacing between kinetochore microtubules from 89 nm to 59 nm. Our interpretation of this result is that PtK1 cells require a minimum kinetochore microtubule-binding capacity for survival during repeated rounds of mitotic division. We estimate the lower limit to be 23 kinetochore microtubules and suggest that this capacity is required to ensure stable attachment during the dynamic and highly stochastic process of kinetochore fiber formation. There is a modest but statistically significant increase in kinetochore microtubule number with chromosome size, indicating that chromosome size is a minor determinant of kinetochore microtubule number.},

Here we investigated the roles of the three mammalian EBs in controlling microtubule dynamics and analyzed the domains involved. Protein depletion and rescue experiments showed that EB1 and EB3, but not EB2, promote persistent microtubule growth by suppressing catastrophes. Furthermore, we demonstrated in vitro and in cells that the EB plus-end tracking behavior depends on the calponin homology domain but does not require dimer formation. In contrast, dimerization is necessary for the EB anti-catastrophe activity in cells; this explains why the EB1 dimerization domain, which disrupts native EB dimers, exhibits a dominant-negative effect. When microtubule dynamics is reconstituted with purifi ed tubulin, EBs promote rather than inhibit catastrophes, suggesting that in cells EBs prevent catastrophes by counteracting other microtubule regulators. This probably occurs through their action on microtubule ends, because catastrophe suppression does not require the EB domains needed for binding to known EB partners. {\textcopyright} 2009 Komarova et al.},

Small Xenopus tropicalis spindles resisted inhibition of two factors essential for assembly of the larger Xenopus laevis spindles: RanGTP, which functions in chromatindriven spindle assembly, and the kinesin-5 motor Eg5, which drives antiparallel microtubule (MT) sliding. This suggested a role for the MT-associated protein TPX2 (targeting factor for Xenopus kinesin-like protein 2), which is regulated by Ran and binds Eg5. Indeed, TPX2 was threefold more abundant in X. tropicalis extracts, and elevated TPX2 levels in X. laevis extracts reduced spindle length and sensitivity to Ran and Eg5 inhibition. Higher TPX2 levels recruited Eg5 to the poles, where MT density increased. We propose that TPX2 levels modulate spindle architecture through Eg5, partitioning MTs between a tiled, antiparallel array that promotes spindle expansion and a cross-linked, parallel architecture that concentrates MTs at spindle poles. {\textcopyright} 2014 Helmke and Heald.},

Throughout prometaphase, puncta of both motors aligned on interpolar microtubules (MTs [ipMTs]), and motor perturbation changed spindle length, as predicted. Competitive motility of purified kinesin-5 and -14 was well described by a stochastic, opposing power stroke model incorporating motor kinetics and load-dependent detachment. Motor parameters from this model were applied to a new stochastic force-balance model for prometaphase spindles, providing a good fit to data from embryos. Maintenance of virtual spindles required dynamic ipMTs and a narrow range of kinesin-5 to kinesin-14 ratios matching that found in embryos. Functional perturbation and modeling suggest that this range can be extended significantly by a disassembling lamin-B envelope that surrounds the prometaphase spindle and augments the finely tuned, antagonistic kinesin force balance to maintain robust prometaphase spindles as MTs assemble and chromosomes are pushed to the equator. {\textcopyright} 2010 Civelekoglu-Scholey et al.},

To interrogate its mechanism, we reconstituted dynamically unstable single isoform S. pombe microtubules with full length Alp14/TOG and Alp7, the TACC-family binding partner of Alp14. We find that Alp14 can drive microtubule plus end growth at GTP-tubulin concentrations at least 10-fold below the usual critical concentration, at the expense of increased catastrophe. This reveals Alp14 to be a highly unusual enzyme that biases the equilibrium for the reaction that it catalyses. Alp7/TACC enhances the effectiveness of Alp14, by increasing its occupancy. Consistent with this, we show in live cells that Alp7 deletion produces very similar MT dynamics defects to Alp14 deletion. The ability of Alp7/14 to accelerate and bias GTP-tubulin exchange at microtubule plus ends allows it to generate long-lived, fast-growing microtubules at very low cellular free tubulin concentrations.},

The proper organization of microtubules within the spindle is driven by motor proteins that exert forces to slide filaments, whereas non-motor proteins crosslink filaments into higher-order motifs, such as overlapping bundles. It is not clear how active and passive forces are integrated to produce regulated mechanical outputs within spindles. Here, we employ simultaneous optical trapping and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to directly measure the frictional forces produced by the mitotic crosslinking protein PRC1 that resist microtubule sliding. These forces scale with microtubule sliding velocity and the number of PRC1 crosslinks but do not depend on overlap length or PRC1 density within overlaps. Our results suggest that PRC1 ensembles act similarly to a mechanical dashpot, producing significant resistance against fast motions but minimal resistance against slow motions, allowing for the integration of diverse motor activities into a single mechanical outcome.},

They have an exceptional bending stiffness that contributes significantly to the mechanical properties of eukaryotic cells. Measurements of the persistence length of microtubules have been published since 10 years but the reported values vary over an order of magnitude without an available explanation. To precisely measure the rigidity of microtubules in their native growing state, we adapted a previously developed bending mode analysis of thermally driven shape fluctuations to the case of an elongating filament that is clamped at one end. Microtubule shapes were quantified using automated image processing, allowing for the characterization of up to five bending modes. When taken together with three other less precise measurements, our rigidity data suggest that fast-growing microtubules are less stiff than slow-growing microtubules. This would imply that care should be taken in interpreting rigidity measurements on stabilized microtubules whose growth history is not known. In addition, time analysis of bending modes showed that higher order modes relax more slowly than expected from simple hydrodynamics, possibly by the effects of internal friction within the microtubule.},

Here, we report that the well-characterized MT polymerase XMAP215 (chTOG/Msps/Stu2p/Alp14/Dis1 homologue) is essential for MT nucleation in Xenopus egg extracts. The concentration of XMAP215 determines the extent of MT nucleation. Even though XMAP215 and the $\gamma$-tubulin ring complex ($\gamma$-TuRC) possess minimal nucleation activity individually, together, these factors synergistically stimulate MT nucleation in vitro. The amino-terminal TOG domains 1-5 of XMAP215 bind to $\alpha$$\beta$-tubulin and promote MT polymerization, whereas the conserved carboxy terminus is required for efficient MT nucleation and directly binds to $\gamma$-tubulin.

For example, many asymmetrically dividing cells differentially specify microtubule behavior at old and new centrosomes. Here we show that yeast spindle pole bodies (SPBs, yeast centrosomes) differentially control the plus-end dynamics and cargoes of their astral microtubules, remotely from the minus-end. The old SPB recruits the kinesin motor protein Kip2, which then translocates to the plus-end of the emanating microtubules, promotes their extension and delivers dynein into the bud. Kip2 recruitment at the SPB depends on Bub2 and Bfa1, and phosphorylation of cytoplasmic Kip2 prevents random lattice binding. Releasing Kip2 of its control by SPBs equalizes its distribution, the length of microtubules and dynein distribution between the mother cell and its bud. These observations reveal that microtubule organizing centers use minus to plus-end directed remote control to individualize microtubule function.},

In vitro and in vivo, all microtubules had a plus-end-out orientation in axons, whereas microtubules in dendrites had mixed orientations. When dendritic microtubules were severed by laser-based microsurgery, we detected equal numbers of plus- and minus-end-out microtubule orientations throughout the dendritic processes. In dendrites, the minus-end-out microtubules were generally more stable and comparable with plus-end-out microtubules in axons.

The Hog1 SAPK in Candida albicans is robustly phosphorylated in response to a number of host-imposed stresses, and is essential for virulence. The current dogma is that stress-induced phosphorylation activates the SAPK, and promotes its nuclear accumulation that is necessary for the expression of SAPK-dependent stress-protective genes. Here we challenge this dogma. C. albicans strains were constructed in which Hog1 was either tethered to the plasma membrane or constitutively nuclear. Strikingly, tethering Hog1 to the plasma membrane did not abrogate stress resistance or stress-induced gene expression. Furthermore, preventing the nuclear accumulation of Hog1 had no impact on C. albicans virulence in two distinct models of systemic infection. However, tethering Hog1 to the plasma membrane did impact on signal fidelity, and on the magnitude and kinetics of the stress-induced phosphorylation of this SAPK. Taken together, these findings challenge the dogma that nuclear accumulation of SAPKs is a pre-requisite for SAPK-dependent gene expression, and reveal that stress-induced nuclear accumulation of Hog1 is dispensable for the virulence of a major human fungal pathogen.},

Dorsalwards convergence brings the string to the midline and, once there, cells enter division 16. This division, or sometimes the next one, and the following cell movement reorient to separate siblings across the midline. This change converts the single string into a bilateral pair of strings, one forming a part of each side of the neural tube.

Upon anaphase onset, kMTs shorten to the pole, whereas ipMTs increase in length. Overlapping MTs are responsible for the maintenance of spindle integrity during anaphase. To dissect the requirements for anaphase spindle stability, we introduced a conditionally functional dicentric chromosome into yeast. When centromeres from the same sister chromatid attach to opposite poles, anaphase spindle elongation is delayed and a DNA breakage-fusion-bridge cycle ensues that is dependent on DNA repair proteins. We find that cell survival after dicentric chromosome activation requires the MT-binding proteins Kar3p, Bim1p, and Ase1p. In their absence, anaphase spindles are prone to collapse and buckle in the presence of a dicentric chromosome. Our analysis reveals the importance of Bim1p in maintaining a stable ipMT overlap zone by promoting polymerization of ipMTs during anaphase, whereas Kar3p contributes to spindle stability by cross-linking spindle MTs.},

Dishevelled (Dvl), a cytoplasmic protein downstream of Fz, forms a Wnt-induced complex with Rac independent of the Wnt-induced Dvl-Rho complex. Depletion or inhibition of Rac function perturbs Xenopus gastrulation without affecting Wnt/Fz activation of the Rho or beta-catenin pathway. We propose that parallel activation of Rac and Rho pathways by Wnt/Fz signaling is required for cell polarity and movements during vertebrate gastrulation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Physical Society. During cell division, sister chromatids are segregated by the mitotic spindle, a bipolar assembly of interdigitating antiparallel polar filaments called microtubules. Establishing a stable overlap region is essential for maintenance of bipolarity, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Using a particle-based stochastic model, we find that the interplay of motors and passive cross-linkers can robustly generate partial overlaps between antiparallel filaments. In this situation, motors reduce the overlap in a length-dependent manner, whereas passive cross-linkers increase it independently of the length. In addition to maintaining structural integrity, passive cross-linkers can thus also have a dynamic role for overlap size regulation.},

abstract = {Background: During vertebrate gastrulation convergence and extension (CE), movements narrow and lengthen embryonic tissues. In Xenopus and zebrafish, a noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway constitutes the vertebrate counterpart to the Drosophila planar cell polarity pathway and regulates mediolateral cell polarization underlying CE. Despite the identification of several signaling molecules required for normal CE, the downstream transducers regulating individual cell behaviors driving CE are only beginning to be elucidated. Moreover, how defective mediolateral cell polarity impacts CE is not understood. Results: Here, we show that overexpression of zebrafish dominant-negative Rho kinase 2 (dnRok2) disrupts CE without altering cell fates, phenocopying noncanonical Wnt signaling mutants. Moreover, Rho kinase 2 (Rok2) overexpression partially suppresses the slb/wnt11 gastrulation phenotype, and ectopic expression of noncanonical Wnts modulates Rok2 intracellular distribution. In addition, time-lapse analyses associate defective dorsal convergence movements with impaired cell elongation, mediolateral orientation, and consequently failure to migrate along straight paths. Transplantation experiments reveal that dnRok2 cells in wild-type hosts neither elongate nor orient their axes. In contrast, wild-type cells are able to elongate their cell bodies in dnRok2 hosts, even though they fail to orient their axes. Conclusions: During zebrafish gastrulation, Rok2 acts downstream of noncanonical Wnt11 signaling to mediate mediolateral cell elongation required for dorsal cell movement along straight paths. Furthermore, elongation and orientation of the cell body are independent properties that require both cell-autonomous and nonautonomous Rok2 function.},

abstract = {The Kinesin-5 motor Cut7 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe plays essential roles in spindle pole separation, leading to the assembly of bipolar spindle. In many organisms, simultaneous inactivation of Kinesin-14s neutralizes Kinesin-5 deficiency. To uncover the molecular network that counteracts Kinesin-5, we have conducted a genetic screening for suppressors that rescue the cut7-22 temperature sensitive mutation, and identified 10 loci. Next generation sequencing analysis reveals that causative mutations are mapped in genes encoding $\alpha$-, $\beta$-tubulins and the microtubule plus-end tracking protein Mal3/EB1, in addition to the components of the Pkl1/Kinesin-14 complex. Moreover, the deletion of various genes required for microtubule nucleation/polymerization also suppresses the cut7 mutant. Intriguingly, Klp2/Kinesin-14 levels on the spindles are significantly increased in cut7 mutants, whereas these increases are negated by suppressors, which may explain the suppression by these mutations/deletions. Consistent with this notion, mild overproduction of Klp2 in these double mutant cells confers temperature sensitivity. Surprisingly, treatment with a microtubule-destabilizing drug not only suppresses cut7 temperature sensitivity but also rescues the lethality resulting from the deletion of cut7 , though a single klp2 deletion per se cannot compensate for the loss of Cut7. We propose that microtubule assembly and/or dynamics antagonize Cut7 functions, and that the orchestration between these two factors is crucial for bipolar spindle assembly.},

abstract = {Faithful segregation of chromosomes during cell division relies on multiple processes such as chromosome attachment and correct spindle positioning. Yet mitotic progression is defined by multiple parameters, which need to be quantitatively evaluated. To study the spatiotemporal control of mitotic progression, we developed a high-content analysis (HCA) approach that combines automated fluorescence microscopy with real-time quantitative image analysis and allows the unbiased acquisition of multiparametric data at the single-cell level for hundreds of cells simultaneously. The Mitotic Analysis and Recording System (MAARS) provides automatic and quantitative single-cell analysis of mitotic progression on an open-source platform. It can be used to analyze specific characteristics such as cell shape, cell size, metaphase/anaphase delays, and mitotic abnormalities including spindle mispositioning, spindle elongation defects, and chromosome segregation defects. Using this HCA approach, we were able to visualize rare and unexpected events of error correction during anaphase in wild-type or mutant cells. Our study illustrates that such an expert system of mitotic progression is able to highlight the complexity of the mechanisms required to prevent chromosome loss during cell division.},

abstract = {The onset of anaphase is triggered by activation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) following silencing of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). APC/C triggers ubiquitination of Securin and Cyclin B, which leads to loss of sister chromatid cohesion and inactivation of Cyclin B/Cdk1, respectively. This promotes relocalization of Aurora B kinase and other components of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC) from centromeres to the spindle midzone. In fission yeast, this is mediated by Clp1 phosphatase-dependent interaction of CPC with Klp9/MKLP2 (kinesin-6). When this interaction is disrupted, kinetochores bi-orient normally, but APC/C activation is delayed via a mechanism that requires Sgo2 and some (Bub1, Mph1/Mps1, and Mad3), but not all (Mad1 and Mad2), components of the SAC and the first, but not second, lysine, glutamic acid, glutamine (KEN) box in Mad3. These data indicate that interaction of CPC with Klp9 terminates a Sgo2-dependent, but Mad2-independent, APC/C-inhibitory pathway that is distinct from the canonical SAC.},

rigor klp9 is not localised to the antiparallel overlap, rather all over, also the cpc components are dispersed, slower sliding and rescues anaphase timing.

abstract = {Kinesins are enzymes that use the energy of ATP to perform mechanical work. There are approximately 14 families of kinesins within the kinesin superfamily. Family classification is derived primarily from alignments of the sequences of the core motor domain. For this reason, the enzymatic behavior and motility of each motor generally reflects its family. At the cellular level, kinesin motors perform a variety of functions during cell division and within the mitotic spindle to ensure that chromosomes are segregated with the highest fidelity possible. The cellular functions of these motors are intimately related to their mechanical and enzymatic properties at the single molecule level. For this reason, motility studies designed to evaluate the activity of purified molecular motors are a requirement in order to understand, mechanistically, how these motors make the mitotic spindle work and what can cause the spindle to fail. This review will focus on a selection of illustrative kinesins, which have been studied at the molecular level in order to inform our understanding of their function in cells. In addition, the review will endeavor to point out some kinesins that have been studied extensively but which still lack sufficient molecular underpinnings to fully predict their contribution to spindle function.},

Intriguingly, this family of MAPs, including Xenopus XMAP215, was reported to have both microtubule stabilising and destabilising activities. While they are shown to regulate various aspects of microtubules, the role in regulating interphase microtubules in animal cells has yet to be established. Here, we show that the depletion or mutation of Msps prevents interphase microtubules from extending to the cell periphery and leads to the formation of stable microtubule bundles. The effect is independent of known Msps regulator or effector proteins, kinesin-13/KinI homologues or D-TACC. Real-time analysis revealed that the depletion of Msps results in a dramatic increase of microtubule pausing with little or no growth. Our study provides the first direct evidence to support a hypothesis that this family of MAPs acts as an antipausing factor to exhibit both microtubule stabilising and destabilising activities. {\textcopyright} 2005 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.},

Using the strength of active force and the thermal persistence length as parameters, we map the phase diagram and identify several non-equilibrium states in this system. In addition to a flowing melt phase, we observe that for sufficiently high activity, collective flow accompanied by the emergence of local polar and nematic order appears in the system. Most strikingly, we identify an activity-driven cross-over from a state of coherently flowing bundles of filaments to a phase with no global flow, formed by filaments coiled into rotating spirals. This suggests a mechanism where the system responds to activity by changing the shape of active agents, an effect with no analogue in systems of active particles without internal degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {The mitotic spindle functions as a molecular micromachine that evenly distributes chromosomes into two daughter cells during cell division. A major mechanical element of the spindle are kinetochore fibers attached to sister kinetochores on each chromosome and laterally linked by a bundle of antiparallel microtubules called the bridging fiber. Spindle microtubules are mainly nucleated at the centrosome and on the lateral surface of existing microtubules by the augmin complex. However, it is unknown how the augmin-mediated nucleation affects functionally distinct microtubule bundles and thus the architecture and forces within the spindle. Here we show, by using siRNA depletion and CRISPR knockout of the augmin complex subunits HAUS6 and HAUS8 in human cells, that augmin is a major contributor to the nucleation of bridging microtubules. Augmin depletion resulted in a {\~{}}70{\%} reduction of the microtubule number in bridging fibers and {\~{}}40{\%} in kinetochore fibers, suggesting that the bridging microtubules are largely nucleated at the surface of present microtubules. In augmin-depleted cells, the interkinetochore distance decreases preferentially for kinetochores that lack a bridging fiber, independently of the thickness of their k-fibers, indicating that augmin affects forces on kinetochores largely via bridging fibers. Without augmin the number of bridging fibers decreases, with the remaining ones mostly confined to the spindle periphery with an increased overlap length. The reduced number of microtubules also results in a slower poleward flux. Our results demonstrate a critical role of augmin in the formation of bridging microtubules and proper architecture of the metaphase spindle, suggesting a model where sliding of augmin-nucleated bridging microtubules promotes poleward flux of k-fibers and thus tension on kinetochores.},

Chemical inactivation of an ATP analog-sensitive form of the Pat1 kinase (pat1-as2) by adding the ATP analog 1-NM-PP1 in G1-arrested cells allows the induction of synchronous meiosis at optimal temperature (25°C). Importantly, this protocol eliminates detrimental effects of elevated temperature (34°C), which is required to inactivate the commonly used temperature-sensitive Pat1 kinase mutant (pat1-114). The addition of the mat-Pc gene to a mat1-M strain further improves chromosome segregation and spore viability. Thus, our protocol offers highly synchronous meiosis at optimal temperature, with most characteristics similar to those of wild-type meiosis.

The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals.

abstract = {Spindle morphogenesis and dynamics follow an orderly sequence of events coupled to the oscillatory activation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). Using S. cerevisiae, we have addressed the requirement of CDK for phosphorylation of the spindle midzone component Ase1p and its significance to spindle assembly. Ase1p is related to human PRC1, a protein negatively regulated by CDK until late mitosis, when it is required for central spindle organization and cytokinesis. By contrast, we show here that Ase1p phosphorylation by CDK promotes correct spindle assembly. Indeed, Ase1p phosphorylation coincident with spindle assembly requires Clb5p, Clb3p and Clb4p. Moreover, in clb5$\Delta$ cells, Ase1p recruitment and the kinetics of spindle formation were perturbed. These phenotypes were enhanced in a cdc28-4 clb5$\Delta$ mutant to the extent that midzone disruption resulted in transient breaks of the short spindle. By contrast, clb3$\Delta$ clb4$\Delta$ cells delayed spindle assembly downstream to Ase1p recruitment. Expression of Ase1(7D) p that mimics the phosphorylated state restored timely recruitment in clb5$\Delta$ cells and fully rescued the corresponding spindle phenotypes. Finally, Ase1(7D) p partially suppressed the spindle assembly delay in clb3$\Delta$ clb4$\Delta$ cells. Thus, Ase1p phosphorylation by CDK promotes the assembly and stability of the mitotic spindle. It follows that CDK may differentially alter the functionality of members of the Ase1p/PRC1 family to place their distinct roles in their respective stage-specific contexts, a further factor of complexity in the organization of pathways promoting spindle assembly and dynamics.},

We recently reported that the PCP protein Vang-like 2 (VANGL2) regulates the endocytosis and cell surface level of membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP14 or MT1-MMP). Here, we further discuss these findings in terms of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, cell migration, and zebrafish gastrulation. We also demonstrate that VANGL2 function impacts the focal degradation of ECM by human cancer cells including the formation or stability of invadopodia. Together, our findings implicate MMP14 as a downstream effector of VANGL2 signaling and suggest a model whereby the regulation of pericellular proteolysis is a fundamental aspect of PCP in migrating cells.},

abstract = {Background: Temporal lobe surgical resection brings seizure remission in up to 80{\%} of patients, with long-term complete seizure freedom in 41{\%}. However, it is unclear how surgery impacts on the structural white matter network, and how the network changes relate to seizure outcome. Methods: We used white matter fibre tractography on preoperative diffusion MRI to generate a structural white matter network, and postoperative T1-weighted MRI to retrospectively infer the impact of surgical resection on this network. We then applied graph theory and machine learning to investigate the properties of change between the preoperative and predicted postoperative networks. Results: Temporal lobe surgery had a modest impact on global network efficiency, despite the disruption caused. This was due to alternative shortest paths in the network leading to widespread increases in betweenness centrality post-surgery. Measurements of network change could retrospectively predict seizure outcomes with 79{\%} accuracy and 65{\%} specificity, which is twice as high as the empirical distribution. Fifteen connections which changed due to surgery were identified as useful for prediction of outcome, eight of which connected to the ipsilateral temporal pole. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the use of network change metrics may have clinical value for predicting seizure outcome. This approach could be used to prospectively predict outcomes given a suggested resection mask using preoperative data only.},

abstract = {The Schizosaccharomyces pombe checkpoint protein Dma1 couples mitotic progression with cytokinesis and is important in delaying mitotic exit and cytokinesis when kinetochores are not properly attached to the mitotic spindle. Dma1 is a ubiquitin ligase and potential functional relative of the human tumor suppressor Chfr. Dma1 delays mitotic exit and cytokinesis by ubiquitinating a scaffold protein (Sid4) of the septation initiation network, which, in turn, antagonizes the ability of the Polo-like kinase Plo1 to promote cell division. Here we identify Dnt1 as a Dma1-binding protein. Several lines of evidence indicate that Dnt1 inhibits Dma1 function during metaphase. First, Dnt1 interacts preferentially with Dma1 during metaphase. Second, Dma1 ubiquitin ligase activity and Sid4 ubiquitination are elevated in dnt1∆ cells. Third, the enhanced mitotic defects in dnt1$\Delta$ plo1 double mutants are partially rescued by deletion of dma1 + , suggesting that the defects in dnt1∆ plo1 double mutants are attributable to excess Dma1 activity. Taken together, these data show that Dnt1 acts to restrain Dma1 activity in early mitosis to allow normal mitotic progression.},

abstract = {Accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis requires biorientation of sister chromatids on the microtubules (MT) of the mitotic spindle. Chromosome-MT binding is mediated by kinetochores, which are multiprotein structures that assemble on centromeric (CEN) DNA. The simple CENs of budding yeast are among the best understood, but the roles of kinesin motor proteins at yeast kinetochores have yet to be determined, despite evidence of their importance in higher eukaryotes. We show that all four nuclear kinesins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae localize to kinetochores and function in three distinct processes. Kip1p and Cin8p, which are kinesin-5/BimC family members, cluster kinetochores into their characteristic bilobed metaphase configuration. Kip3p, a kinesin-8,-13/KinI kinesin, synchronizes poleward kinetochore movement during anaphase A. The kinesin-14 motor Kar3p appears to function at the subset of kinetochores that become detached from spindle MTs. These data demonstrate roles for structurally diverse motors in the complex processes of chromosome segregation and reveal important similarities and intriguing differences between higher and lower eukaryotes. {\textcopyright} The Rockefeller University Press.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Budding yeast treated with hydroxyurea (HU) activate the S phase checkpoint kinase Rad53, which prevents DNA replication forks from undergoing aberrant structural transitions and nuclease processing. Rad53 is also required to prevent premature extension of the mitotic spindle that assembles during a HU-extended S phase. Here we present evidence that checkpoint restraint of spindle extension is directly coupled to Rad53 control of replication fork stability. In budding yeast, centromeres are flanked by replication origins that fire in early S phase. Mutations affecting the Zn {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} -finger of Dbf4, an origin activator, preferentially reduce centromere-proximal origin firing in HU, corresponding with suppression of rad53 spindle extension. Inactivating Exo1 nuclease or displacing centromeres from origins provides a similar suppression. Conversely, short-circuiting Rad53 targeting of Dbf4, Sld3, and Dun1, substrates contributing to fork stability, induces spindle extension. These results reveal spindle extension in HU-treated rad53 mutants is a consequence of replication fork catastrophes at centromeres. When such catastrophes occur, centromeres become susceptible to nucleases, disrupting kinetochore function and spindle force balancing mechanisms. At the same time, our data indicate centromere duplication is not required to stabilize S phase spindle structure, leading us to propose a model for how monopolar kinetochore-spindle attachments may contribute to spindle force balance in HU. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this study, we analyse the role of the Van Gogh/strabismus gene in the formation of these complexes and cell polarisation. We find that the Strabismus protein becomes asymmetrically localised to the proximal edge of cells. In the absence of strabismus activity, the planar polarity proteins Dishevelled and Prickle are mislocalised in the cell. We show that Strabismus binds directly to Dishevelled and Prickle and is able to recruit them to membranes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the putative PDZ-binding motif at the C terminus of Strabismus is not required for its function. We propose a two-step model for assembly of Frizzledcontaining asymmetric protein complexes at cell boundaries. First, Strabismus acts together with Frizzled and the atypical cadherin Flamingo to mediate apicolateral recruitment of planar polarity proteins including Dishevelled and Prickle. In the second phase, Dishevelled and Prickle are required for these proteins to become asymmetrically distributed on the proximodistal axis.},

The molecular mechanisms by which a subset of dynamic microtubules from the metaphase spindle are selected and organized into a stable midzone array are poorly understood. Here, we show using in vitro reconstitution assays that PRC1 and kinesin-4, two microtubule-associated proteins required for midzone assembly, can tag microtubule plus ends. Remarkably, the size of these tags is proportional to filament length. We determine the crystal structure of the PRC1 homodimer and map the protein-protein interactions needed for tagging microtubule ends. Importantly, length-dependent microtubule plus-end-tagging by PRC1 is also observed in dividing cells. Our findings suggest how biochemically similar microtubules can be differentially marked, based on length, for selective regulation during the formation of specialized arrays, such as those required for cytokinesis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Introduction: During anaphase B in mitosis, polymerization and sliding of overlapping spindle microtubules (MTs) contribute to the outward movement the spindle pole bodies (SPBs). To probe the mechanism of spindle elongation, we combine fluorescence microscopy, photobleaching, and laser microsurgery in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Results: We demonstrate that a green laser cuts intracellular structures in yeast cells with high spatial specificity. By using laser microsurgery, we cut mitotic spindles labeled with GFP-tubulin at various stages of anaphase B. Although cutting generally caused early anaphase spindles to disassemble, midanaphase spindle fragments continued to elongate. In particular, when the spindle was cut near a SPB, the larger spindle fragment continued to elongate in the direction of the cut. Photobleach marks showed that sliding of overlapping midzone MTs was responsible for the elongation of the spindle fragment. Spindle midzone fragments not connected to either of the two spindle poles also elongated. Equatorial microtubule organizing center (eMTOC) activity was not affected in cells with one detached pole but was delayed or absent in cells with two detached poles. Conclusions: These studies reveal that the spindle midzone is necessary and sufficient for the stabilization of MT ends and for spindle elongation. By contrast, SPBs are not required for elongation, but they contribute to the attachment of the nuclear envelope and chromosomes to the spindle, and to cell cycle progression. Laser microsurgery provides a means by which to dissect the mechanics of the spindle in yeast.},

In yeast, proteins and large heterochromatic domains including telomeres are also peripherally localized, but there is no evidence that yeast have lamins or a fibrous nuclear envelope scaffold. Nonetheless, we found that the Lem2 and Man1 proteins of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, evolutionarily distant relatives of the Lap2/Emerin/Man1 (LEM) sub-family of animal cell lamin-associated proteins, perform fundamental functions of the animal cell lamina. These integral inner nuclear membrane localized proteins, with nuclear localized DNA binding Helix-Extension-Helix (HEH) domains, impact nuclear envelope structure and integrity, are essential for the enrichment of telomeres at the nuclear periphery and by means of their HEH domains anchor chromatin, most likely transcriptionally repressed heterochromatin, to the nuclear periphery. These data indicate that the core functions of the nuclear lamina are conserved between fungi and animal cells and can be performed in fission yeast, without lamins or other intermediate filament proteins.},

abstract = {Kinesin is a molecular walking machine that organizes cells by hauling packets of components directionally along microtubules. The physical mechanism that impels directional stepping is uncertain. We show here that, under very high backward loads, the intrinsic directional bias in kinesin stepping can be reversed such that the motor walks sustainedly backwards in a previously undescribed mode of ATP-dependent backward processivity. We find that both forward and backward 8-nm steps occur on the microsecond timescale and that both occur without mechanical substeps on this timescale. The data suggest an underlying mechanism in which, once ATP has bound to the microtubule-attached head, the other head undergoes a diffusional search for its next site, the outcome of which can be biased by an applied load.},

abstract = {Self-organization of cellular structures is an emerging principle underlying cellular architecture. Properties of dynamic microtubules and microtubule-binding proteins contribute to the self-assembly of structures such as microtubule asters. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, longitudinal arrays of cytoplasmic microtubule bundles regulate cell polarity and nuclear positioning. These bundles are thought to be organized from the nucleus at multiple interphase microtubule organizing centres (iMTOCs). Here, we find that microtubule bundles assemble even in cells that lack a nucleus. These bundles have normal organization, dynamics and orientation, and exhibit anti-parallel overlaps in the middle of the cell. The mechanisms that are responsible for formation of these microtubule bundles include cytoplasmic microtubule nucleation, microtubule release from the equatorial MTOC (eMTOC), and the dynamic fusion and splitting of microtubule bundles. Bundle formation and organization are dependent on mto1p (gamma-TUC associated protein), ase1p (PRC1), klp2p (kinesin-14) and tip1p (CLIP-170). Positioning of nuclear fragments and polarity factors by these microtubules illustrates how self-organization of these bundles contributes to establishing global spatial order.},

We studied the response of 1,065 individual neurons in the human hippocampus and amygdala while neurosurgical patients made memory retrieval decisions together with a confidence judgment. Combining behavioral, neuronal and computational analysis, we identified a population of memory-selective (MS) neurons whose activity signaled stimulus familiarity and confidence, as assessed by subjective report. In contrast, the activity of visually selective (VS) neurons was not sensitive to memory strength. The groups further differed in response latency, tuning and extracellular waveforms. The information provided by MS neurons was sufficient for a race model to decide stimulus familiarity and retrieval confidence. Together, our results indicate a trial-by-trial relationship between a specific group of neurons and declared memory strength in humans. We suggest that VS and MS neurons are a substrate for declarative memories.},

A number of mechanisms have been described to contribute to the final shape of a tissue or organ, ranging from cell intercalation to the response of cells to chemotactic cues.

Indeed, there is increasing evidence implicating spindle misorientation in tissue and organ misshaping, which underlies disease conditions such as tumorigenesis or polycystic kidneys. Here we review recent studies addressing how the direction of tissue growth is determined by the orientation of cell division and how both extrinsic and intrinsic cues control the position of the mitotic spindle.},

abstract = {The actin cortex of animal cells is the main determinant of cellular mechanics. The continuous turnover of cortical actin filaments enables cells to quickly respond to stimuli. Recent work has shown that most of the cortical actin is generated by only two actin nucleators, the Arp2/3 complex and the formin Diaph1. However, our understanding of their interplay, their kinetics, and the length distribution of the filaments that they nucleate within living cells is poor. Such knowledge is necessary for a thorough comprehension of cellular processes and cell mechanics from basic polymer physics principles. We determined cortical assembly rates in living cells by using single-molecule fluorescence imaging in combination with stochastic simulations. We find that formin-nucleated filaments are, on average, 10 times longer than Arp2/3-nucleated filaments. Although formin-generated filaments represent less than 10{\%} of all actin filaments, mechanical measurements indicate that they are important determinants of cortical elasticity. Tuning the activity of actin nucleators to alter filament length distribution may thus be a mechanism allowing cells to adjust their macroscopic mechanical properties to their physiological needs.},

abstract = {Meiotic recombination requires pairing of homologous chromosomes, the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. When pairing occurs during meiotic prophase in fission yeast, the nucleus oscillates between the cell poles driven by astral microtubules. During these oscillations, the telomeres are clustered at the spindle pole body (SPB), located at the leading edge of the moving nucleus and the rest of each chromosome dangles behind. Here, we show that the oscillatory nuclear movement of meiotic prophase is dependent on cytoplasmic dynein. We have cloned the gene encoding a cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain of fission yeast. Most of the cells disrupted for the gene show no gross defect during mitosis and complete meiosis to form four viable spores, but they lack the nuclear movements of meiotic prophase. Thus, the dynein heavy chain is required for these oscillatory movements. Consistent with its essential role in such nuclear movement, dynein heavy chain tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) is localized at astral microtubules and the SPB during the movements. In dynein-disrupted cells, meiotic recombination is significantly reduced, indicating that the dynein function is also required for efficient meiotic recombination. In accordance with the reduced recombination, which leads to reduced crossing over, chromosome missegregation is increased in the mutant. Moreover, both the formation of a single cluster of centromeres and the colocalization of homologous regions on a pair of homologous chromosomes are significantly inhibited in the mutant. These results strongly suggest that the dynein-driven nuclear movements of meiotic prophase are necessary for efficient pairing of homologous chromosomes in fission yeast, which in turn promotes efficient meiotic recombination.},

abstract = {The cleavage furrow in Xenopus zygotes is positioned by two large microtubule asters that grow out from the poles of the first mitotic spindle. Where these asters meet at the midplane, they assemble a disk-shaped interaction zone consisting of anti-parallel microtubule bundles coated with chromosome passenger complex (CPC) and centralspindlin that instructs the cleavage furrow. Here we investigate the mechanism that keeps the two asters separate and forms a distinct boundary between them, focusing on the conserved cytokinesis midzone proteins Prc1 and Kif4A. Prc1E, the egg orthologue of Prc1, and Kif4A were recruited to anti-parallel bundles at interaction zones between asters in Xenopus egg extracts. Prc1E was required for Kif4A recruitment but not vice versa. Microtubule plus-end growth slowed and terminated preferentially within interaction zones, resulting in a block to interpenetration that depended on both Prc1E and Kif4A. Unexpectedly, Prc1E and Kif4A were also required for radial order of large asters growing in isolation, apparently to compensate for the direction-randomizing influence of nucleation away from centrosomes. We propose that Prc1E and Kif4, together with catastrophe factors, promote "anti-parallel pruning" that enforces radial organization within asters and generates boundaries to microtubule growth between asters.},

S. pombe prm1$\Delta$ mutant exhibits an almost complete blockade in cell fusion and an abnormal distribution of the plasma membrane and cell wall in the area of cell-cell interaction. The distribution of cellular envelopes is similar to that described for mutants devoid of the Fig1-related claudin-like Dni proteins; however, prm1(+) and the dni(+) genes act in different subpathways. Time-lapse analyses show that in the wild-type S. pombe strain, the distribution of phosphatidylserine in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane undergoes some modification before an opening is observed in the cross wall at the cell-cell contact region. In the prm1$\Delta$ mutant, this membrane modification does not take place, and the cross wall between the mating partners is not extensively degraded; plasma membrane forms invaginations and fingers that sometimes collapse/retract and that are sometimes strengthened by the synthesis of cell-wall material. Neither prm1$\Delta$ nor prm1$\Delta$ dni$\Delta$ zygotes lyse after cell-cell contact in medium containing and lacking calcium. Response to drugs that inhibit lipid synthesis or interfere with lipids is different in wild-type, prm1$\Delta$, and dni1$\Delta$ strains, suggesting that membrane structure/organization/dynamics is different in all these strains and that Prm1p and the Dni proteins exert some functions required to guarantee correct membrane organization that are critical for cell fusion.},

Analytical solutions for the time-dependent shapes of such moving polymers are obtained within an analysis applicable to small-amplitude deformations. In the case of oscillatory driving, particular attention is paid to a characteristic length determined by the frequency of oscillation, the polymer persistence length, and the viscous drag coefficient. Experiments on actin filaments manipulated with optical traps confirm the scaling law predicted by the analysis and provide a new technique for measuring the elastic bending modulus. Exploiting this model, we also present a reanalysis of several published experiments on microtubules.},

Kinetochore proteins are highly dynamic and exhibit programmed cell cycle changes in localization. The CEN-specific histone, Cse4p, is one of a few stable kinetochore components and remains associated with CEN DNA throughout mitosis. In contrast, several other kinetochore proteins have been observed along interpolar microtubules and at the midzone during anaphase. The inner kinetochore protein, Ndc10p, is enriched at the spindle midzone in late anaphase. We show that Ndc10p is transported to the plus-ends of interpolar microtubules at the midzone during anaphase, a process that requires survivin (Bir1p), a member of the aurora kinase (Ipl1p) complex, and Cdc14p phosphatase. In addition, Ndc10p is required for essential non-kinetochore processes during mitosis. Cells lacking functional Ndc10p show defects in spindle stability during anaphase and failure to split the septin ring during cytokinesis. This latter phenotype leads to a cell separation defect in ndc10-1 cells. We propose that Ndc10p plays a direct role in maintaining spindle stability during anaphase and coordinates the completion of cell division after chromosome segregation. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Remarkably, RCC1 beads oscillate within spindles from pole to pole, a behavior that could be converted to a more typical, stable association by the addition of a kinesin together with RCC1.

abstract = {Asymmetric localization of Ran regulators (RanGAP1 and RanGEF/RCC1) produces a gradient of RanGTP across the nuclear envelope [1]. In higher eukaryotes, the nuclear envelope breaks down as the cell enters mitosis (designated “open” mitosis). This nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) leads to collapse of the RanGTP gradient and the diffusion of nuclear and cytoplasmic macromolecules in the cell, resulting in irreversible progression of the cell cycle [2–7]. On the other hand, in many fungi, chromosome segregation takes place without NEBD (designated “closed” mitosis). Here we report that in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, despite the nuclear envelope and the nuclear pore complex remaining intact throughout both the meiotic and mitotic cell cycles, nuclear proteins diffuse into the cytoplasm transiently for a few minutes at the onset of anaphase of meiosis II. We also found that nuclear protein diffusion into the cytoplasm occurred coincidently with nuclear localization of Rna1, an S. pombe RanGAP1 homolog that is usually localized in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that nuclear localization of RanGAP1 and depression of RanGTP activity in the nucleus may be mechanistically tied to meiosis-specific diffusion of nuclear proteins into the cytoplasm. This nucleocytoplasmic shuffling of RanGAP1 and nuclear proteins represents virtual breakdown of the nuclear envelope.},

Kinetochore movements are coupled to single microtubule plus-end polymerization/depolymerization at kinetochore attachment sites. Here, we use computer modeling to test possible mechanisms controlling chromosome alignment during yeast metaphase by simulating experiments that determine the 1) mean positions of kinetochore Cse4-GFP, 2) extent of oscillation of kinetochores during metaphase as measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of kinetochore Cse4-GFP, 3) dynamics of kMTs as measured by FRAP of GFP-tubulin, and 4) mean positions of unreplicated chromosome kinetochores that lack pulling forces from a sister kinetochore. We rule out a number of possible models and find the best fit between theory and experiment when it is assumed that kinetochores sense both a spatial gradient that suppresses kMT catastrophe near the poles and attachment site tension that promotes kMT rescue at higher amounts of chromatin stretch. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The American Society for Cell Biology.},

The best fit to the experimental data was achieved by kinetochores sensing a stable gradient between the poles to spatially control kMT plus-end catastrophe frequency and by sensing tension generated via chromatin stretching be- tween sister kinetochores to control kMT plus-end rescue frequency.

abstract = {EB1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein that localizes to the plus ends of growing microtubules. In yeast, the EB1 homologue (BIMI) has been shown to modulate microtubule dynamics and link microtubules to the cortex, but the functions of metazoan EB1 proteins remain unknown. Using a novel preparation of the Drosophila S2 cell line that promotes cell attachment and spreading, we visualized dynamics of single microtubules in real time and found that depletion of EB1 by RNA-mediated inhibition (RNAi) in interphase cells causes a dramatic increase in nondynamic microtubules (neither growing nor shrinking), but does not alter overall microtubule organization. In contrast, several defects in microtubule organization are observed in RNAi-treated mitotic cells, including a drastic reduction in astral microtubules, malformed mitotic spindles, defocused spindle poles, and mispositioning of spindles away from the cell center. Similar phenotypes were observed in mitotic spindles of Drosophila embryos that were microinjected with anti-EB1 antibodies. In addition, live cell imaging of mitosis in Drosophila embryos reveals defective spindle elongation and chromosomal segregation during anaphase after antibody injection. Our results reveal crucial roles for EB1 in mitosis, which we postulate involves its ability to promote the growth and interactions of microtubules within the central spindle and at the cell cortex.},

We found that the membrane potential of all cell types became more depolarized and (with the exception of somatostatin-positive interneurons) less variable during locomotion.

abstract = {Spindle elongation in anaphase of mitosis is a cell cycle-regulated process that requires coordination between polymerization, cross-linking, and sliding of microtubules (MTs). Proteins that assemble at the spindle midzone may be important for this process. In this study, we show that Ase1 and the separase-Slk19 complex drive midzone assembly in yeast. Whereas the conserved MT-bundling protein Ase1 establishes a midzone, separase-Slk19 is required to focus and center midzone components. An important step leading to spindle midzone assembly is the dephosphorylation of Ase1 by the protein phosphatase Cdc14 at the beginning of anaphase. Failure to dephosphorylate Ase1 delocalizes midzone proteins and delays the second, slower phase of anaphase B. In contrast, in cells expressing nonphosphorylated Ase1, anaphase spindle extension is faster, and spindles frequently break. Cdc14 also controls the separase-Slk19 complex indirectly via the Aurora B kinase. Thus, Cdc14 regulates spindle midzone assembly and function directly through Ase1 and indirectly via the separase-Slk19 complex.},

abstract = {Microtubule (MT) dynamic instability is fundamental to many cell functions, but its mechanism remains poorly understood, in part because it is difficult to gain information about the dimer-scale events at the MT tip. To address this issue, we used a dimer-scale computational model of MT assembly that is consistent with tubulin structure and biochemistry, displays dynamic instability, and covers experimentally relevant spans of time. It allows us to correlate macroscopic behaviors (dynamic instability parameters) with microscopic structures (tip conformations) and examine protofilament structure as the tip spontaneously progresses through both catastrophe and rescue. The model's behavior suggests that several commonly held assumptions about MT dynamics should be reconsidered. Moreover, it predicts that short, interprotofilament "cracks" (laterally unbonded regions between protofilaments) exist even at the tips of growing MTs and that rapid fluctuations in the depths of these cracks influence both catastrophe and rescue. We conclude that experimentally observed microtubule behavior can best be explained by a "stochastic cap" model in which tubulin subunits hydrolyze GTP according to a first-order reaction after they are incorporated into the lattice; catastrophe and rescue result from stochastic fluctuations in the size, shape, and extent of lateral bonding of the cap. {\textcopyright} 2012 Margolin et al.},

abstract = {Recent studies have found that microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) can regulate the dynamical properties of microtubules in unexpected ways. For most MAPs, there is an inverse relationship between their effects on the speed of growth and the frequency of catastrophe, the conversion of a growing microtubule to a shrinking one. Such a negative correlation is predicted by the standard GTP-cap model, which posits that catastrophe is due to loss of a stabilizing cap of GTP-tubulin at the end of a growing microtubule. However, many other MAPs, notably Kinesin-4 and combinations of EB1 with XMAP215, contradict this general rule. In this review, we show that a more nuanced, but still simple, GTP-cap model, can account for the diverse regulatory activities of MAPs. The standard GTP-cap model of microtubule dynamics predicts that faster growing microtubules have a larger stabilizing cap, which results in a lower catastrophe frequency. Recent studies show that for many microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) this inverse relationship between growth and catastrophe breaks down.MAPs whose effects on microtubule dynamics do not accord with the standard GTP-cap model include XMAP215, kinesin-8, EB1, and kinesin-4.GTP-cap models in which hydrolysis cannot occur in the GTP-tubulin subunits at the end of the protofilaments (i.e., hydrolysis is coupled to polymerization) but does occur stochastically in the lattice (i.e., random hydrolysis) account for the observed effects of MAPs on microtubule dynamics.},

In cells, myosin and actin work in a dense macromolecular environment. High concentrations of macromolecules dramatically reduce the amount of free space available for all solutes, which results in an effective increase of the solutes' chemical potential and protein stabilization. Moreover, in a crowded solution, the chemical potential depends on the size of the solute, with larger molecules experiencing a larger excluded volume than smaller ones. Therefore, since myosin interacts with two ligands of different sizes (actin and ATP), macromolecular crowding can modulate the kinetics of individual steps of the actomyosin ATPase cycle. To emulate the effect of crowding in cells, we studied actomyosin cycle reactions in the presence of a high-molecular-weight polymer, Ficoll70. We observed an increase in the maximum velocity of the actomyosin ATPase cycle, and our transient-kinetics experiments showed that virtually all individual steps of the actomyosin cycle were affected by the addition of Ficoll70. The observed effects of macromolecular crowding on the myosin-ligand interaction cannot be explained by the increase of a solute's chemical potential. A time-resolved F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer experiment confirmed that the myosin head assumes a more compact conformation in the presence of Ficoll70 than in a dilute solution. We conclude that the crowding-induced myosin conformational change plays a major role in the changed kinetics of actomyosin ATPase.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Genetic evidence indicates that the major gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 are involved in mammalian craniofacial development. Since these matrix metalloproteinases are secreted as proenzymes that require activation, their tissue distribution does not necessarily reflect the sites of enzymatic activity. Information regarding the spatial and temporal expression of gelatinolytic activity in the head of the mammalian embryo is sparse. Sensitive in situ zymography with dye-quenched gelatin (DQ-gelatin) has been introduced recently; gelatinolytic activity results in a local increase in fluorescence. Using frontal sections of wild-type mouse embryo heads from embryonic day 14.5-15.5, we optimized and validated a simple double-labeling in situ technique for combining DQ-gelatin zymography with immunofluorescence staining. MMP inhibitors were tested to confirm the specificity of the reaction in situ, and results were compared to standard SDS-gel zymography of tissue extracts. Double-labeling was used to show the spatial relationship in situ between gelatinolytic activity and immunostaining for gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, collagenase 3 (MMP-13) and MT1-MMP (MMP-14), a major activator of pro-gelatinases. Strong gelatinolytic activity, which partially overlapped with MMP proteins, was confirmed for Meckel's cartilage and developing mandibular bone. In addition, we combined in situ zymography with immunostaining for extracellular matrix proteins that are potential gelatinase substrates. Interestingly, gelatinolytic activity colocalized precisely with laminin-positive basement membranes at specific sites around growing epithelia in the developing mouse head, such as the ducts of salivary glands or the epithelial fold between tongue and lower jaw region. Thus, this sensitive method allows to associate, with high spatial resolution, gelatinolytic activity with epithelial morphogenesis in the embryo.},

abstract = {The fission yeast DNA repair gene rad21+ is essential for cell growth. To investigate the function essential for cell proliferation, we have isolated a temperature-sensitive mutant of the rad21+ gene. The mutant, rad21-K1, showed abnormal mitosis at the nonpermissive temperature. Some cells contained abnormal nuclear structures, such as condensed chromosomes with short spindles, or chromosomes stretched or unequally separated by elongating spindles. Other cells exhibited the displaced nucleus or a cut- like phenotype. Similar abnormalities were observed when the Rad21 protein was depleted from cells. We therefore concluded that Rad21 is essential for proper segregation of chromosomes. Moreover, the rad21-K1 mutant is sensitive not only to UV and $\gamma$-ray irradiation but to thiabendazole and hydroxyurea, indicating that Rad21 plays important roles in microtubule function, DNA repair, and S phase function. The relation to the microtubule function was further confirmed by the fact that rad21+ genetically interacts with tubulin genes, nda2+ and nda3+. Finally, the growth of the rad21-K1 mutant was inhibited at the permissive temperature by introduction of another mutation in the cut9+ gene, coding for a component of the 20S cyclosome/anaphase promoting complex, which is involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. The results suggest that these diverse functions of Rad21 may be facilitated through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.},

abstract = {Animal cells actively generate contractile stress in the actin cortex, a thin actin network beneath the cell membrane, to facilitate shape changes during processes like cytokinesis and motility. On the microscopic scale, this stress is generated by myosin molecular motors, which bind to actin cytoskeletal filaments and use chemical energy to exert pulling forces. To decipher the physical basis for the regulation of cell shape changes, here, we use a cell-like system with a cortex anchored to the outside or inside of a liposome membrane. This system enables us to dissect the interplay between motor pulling forces, cortex-membrane anchoring, and network connectivity. We show that cortices on the outside of liposomes either spontaneously rupture and relax built-up mechanical stress by peeling away around the liposome or actively compress and crush the liposome. The decision between peeling and crushing depends on the cortical tension determined by the amount of motors and also on the connectivity of the cortex and its attachment to the membrane. Membrane anchoring strongly affects the morphology of cortex contraction inside liposomes: cortices contract inward when weakly attached, whereas they contract toward the membrane when strongly attached. We propose a physical model based on a balance of active tension and mechanical resistance to rupture. Our findings show how membrane attachment and network connectivity are able to regulate actin cortex remodeling and membrane-shape changes for cell polarization.},

abstract = {We consider the forced detachment of a thin-walled vesicle bonded to a substrate for two particular cases. In both cases, the configuration is three-dimensional and the bonding is assumed to occur under conditions of axial symmetry for which the adhered area is always circular. Detachment is driven by a force applied to the top of the vesicle in a direction normal to the substrate surface. The first case is the static or time-independent situation of a vesicle for which bonding is the result of nonspecific interactions between the vesicle and substrate surfaces. For this case, it is shown that the radius of the adhesion patch is determined implicitly by the pulling force F. The maximum pulling force Fcr, beyond which the adhered configuration is unstable and the detachment proceeds spontaneously, can also be calculated implicitly. For the particular case of weak adhesion, all significant parameters of the detachment process can be determined explicitly. The second case studied is the time-dependent debonding of a vesicle for which adhesion with the substrate is the result of specific interactions between binders on the two surfaces, typical of biological materials for which the binders are ligand-receptor protein pairs. By treating the detachment process as a result of the debonding of the protein pairs at the edge of the circular adhesion patch, the governing equation for the radius of the adhesion patch is obtained. If a constant force is suddenly applied, it is found that the elapsed time to full detachment is proportional to the magnitude of this force to the power -1.1; alternatively, if the force applied to the vesicle increases linearly in time, it is found that the value of the force at complete detachment is proportional to the applied loading rate over(F, ??) to the power 0.39, in agreement with recent experimental observations. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In many organisms, early embryonic development is characterized by a series of reductive cell divisions that result in rapid increases in cell number and concomitant decreases in cell size. Intracellular organelles, such as the nucleus and mitotic spindle, also become progressively smaller during this developmental window, but the molecular and mechanistic underpinnings of these scaling relationships are not fully understood. For the mitotic spindle, changes in cytoplasmic volume are sufficient to account for size scaling during early development in certain organisms. This observation is consistent with models that evoke a limiting component, whereby the smaller absolute number of spindle components in smaller cells limits spindle size. Here we investigate the role of a candidate factor for developmental spindle scaling, the microtubule polymerase XMAP215. Microinjection of additional XMAP215 protein into Xenopus laevis embryos was sufficient to induce the assembly of larger spindles during developmental stages 6.5, 7, and 8, whereas addition of a polymerase-incompetent XMAP215 mutant resulted in a downward shift in the in vivo spindle scaling curve. In sum, these results indicate that even small cells are able to produce larger spindles if microtubule growth rates are increased and suggest that structural components are not limiting.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Using time-lapse total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that the EB1 homologue Mal3 has an enhanced affinity for growing microtubule end structures as opposed to the microtubule lattice. This allows it to track growing microtubule ends autonomously by an end recognition mechanism. In addition, Mal3 acts as a factor that mediates loading of the processive motor Tea2 and its cargo, the Clip170 homologue Tip1, onto the microtubule lattice. The interaction of all three proteins is required for the selective tracking of growing microtubule plus ends by both Tea2 and Tip1. Our results dissect the collective interactions of the constituents of this plus-end tracking system and show how these interactions lead to the emergence of its dynamic behaviour. We expect that such in vitro reconstitutions will also be essential for the mechanistic dissection of other plus-end tracking systems. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {During vertebrate mitosis, the centromere-associated kinesin CENP-E (centromere protein E) transports misaligned chromosomes to the plus ends of spindle microtubules. Subsequently, the kinetochores that form at the centromeres establish stable associations with microtubule ends, which assemble and disassemble dynamically. Here we provide evidence that after chromosomes have congressed and bi-oriented, the CENP-E motor continues to play an active role at kinetochores, enhancing their links with dynamic microtubule ends. Using a combination of single-molecule approaches and laser trapping in vitro, we demonstrate that once reaching microtubule ends, CENP-E converts from a lateral transporter into a microtubule tip-tracker that maintains association with both assembling and disassembling microtubule tips. Computational modelling of this behaviour supports our proposal that CENP-E tip-tracks bi-directionally through a tethered motor mechanism, which relies on both the motor and tail domains of CENP-E. Our results provide a molecular framework for the contribution of CENP-E to the stability of attachments between kinetochores and dynamic microtubule ends. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Our studies of a unique allele of the budding yeast Ipl1/Aurora protein kinase revealed that it is required for centrosome-mediated spindle assembly in the absence of the BimC motor protein Cin8.

Consistent with the possibility that Ipl1 regulates Ase1, an {\textless}i{\textgreater}ase1{\textless}/i{\textgreater} mutant lacking the Ipl1 consensus phosphorylation sites cannot assemble spindles in the absence of Cin8. In addition, Ase1 phosphorylation and localization were altered in an {\textless}i{\textgreater}ipl1{\textless}/i{\textgreater} mutant.

In the kidney, defects in the establishment or maintenance of tubule diameter are associated with one of the most common inherited human disorders, polycystic kidney disease. Here we show that attenuation of Wnt9b signaling during kidney morphogenesis affects the planar cell polarity of the epithelium and leads to tubules with significantly increased diameter. Although previous studies showed that polarized cell divisions maintain the diameter of postnatal kidney tubules, we find that cell divisions are randomly oriented during embryonic development. Our data suggest that diameter is established during early morphogenetic stages by convergent extension processes and maintained by polarized cell divisions. Wnt9b, signaling through the non-canonical Rho/Jnk branch of the Wnt pathway, is necessary for both of these processes.},

We have recently shown that an overlap bundle, termed bridging fiber, links outermost sister k-fibers. However, the relationship between overlap bundles and k-fibers throughout the spindle remained unknown. Here, we show that in a metaphase spindle more than 90{\%} of overlap bundles act as a bridge between sister k-fibers. We found that the number of PRC1-GFP-labeled bundles per spindle is nearly the same as the number of kinetochore pairs. Live-cell imaging revealed that kinetochore movement in the equatorial plane of the spindle is highly correlated with the movement of the coupled PRC1-GFP-labeled fiber, whereas the correlation with other fibers decreases with increasing distance. Analysis of endogenous PRC1 localization confirmed the results obtained with PRC1-GFP PRC1 knockdown reduced the bridging fiber thickness and interkinetochore distance throughout the spindle, suggesting a function of PRC1 in bridging microtubule organization and force balance in the metaphase spindle.},

abstract = {The fission yeast interphase spindle pole body (SPB) is a bipartite structure in which a bulky cytoplasmic domain is separated from a nuclear component by the nuclear envelope. During mitosis, the SPB is incorporated into a fenestra that forms within the envelope during mitotic commitment. Closure of this fenestra during anaphase B/mitotic exit returns the cytoplasmic component to the cytoplasmic face of an intact interphase nuclear envelope. Here we show that Brr6 is transiently recruited to SPBs at both SPB insertion and extrusion. Brr6 is required for both SPB insertion and nuclear envelope integrity during anaphase B/mitotic exit. Genetic interactions with apq12 and defective sterol assimilation suggest that Brr6 may alter envelope composition at SPBs to promote SPB insertion and extrusion. The restriction of the Brr6 domain to eukaryotes that use a polar fenestra in an otherwise closed mitosis suggests a conserved role in fenestration to enable a single microtubule organizing center to nucleate both cytoplasmic and nuclear microtubules on opposing sides of the nuclear envelope. {\textcopyright} 2011 Tamm et al.},

Bacteria elaborate diverse strategies to interact and compete with other organisms, including the deployment of protein secretion systems. The type VI secretion system (T6SS) delivers toxic effector proteins into host eukaryotic cells and competitor bacterial cells, but, surprisingly, T6SS-delivered effectors targeting fungal cells have not been reported. Here we show that the ‘antibacterial' T6SS of Serratia marcescens can act against fungal cells, including pathogenic Candida species, and identify the previously undescribed effector proteins responsible. These antifungal effectors, Tfe1 and Tfe2, have distinct impacts on the target cell, but both can ultimately cause fungal cell death. ‘In competition' proteomics analysis revealed that T6SS-mediated delivery of Tfe2 disrupts nutrient uptake and amino acid metabolism in fungal cells, and leads to the induction of autophagy. Intoxication by Tfe1, in contrast, causes a loss of plasma membrane potential. Our findings extend the repertoire of the T6SS and suggest that antifungal T6SSs represent widespread and important determinants of the outcome of bacterial–fungal interactions.},

Fission yeast Dis1 belongs to the Dis1/XMAP215/TOG family that is required for proper microtubule dynamics. Here, we report that Dis1is regulated by Cdc2 phosphorylation and that this mitotic phosphorylation ensures the fidelity of chromosome segregation. Whereas mutants Dis16A and Dis16E that substitute all of the six Cdc2 sites for Ala or Glu, respectively, produce colonies at 22°C-36°C, Dis16A but not Dis16E loses a minichromosome and reveals aberrant chromosome segregation at significant frequencies. Dis1WT is recruited to two regions of the mitotic spindle: kinetochores (possibly also kinetochore microtubules) in metaphase and the pole-to-pole microtubule lattice in anaphase. Mutant Dis16E preferentially binds to metaphase kinetochores, whereas Dis16A, which is located along microtubules, fails in its accumulation at kinetochores. Dis16A displays synthetic lethality with the mis12-537, which is a mutant that compromises kinetochore function. Dis16E mimics the Cdc2-phosphorylated form of Dis1WT, whereas Dis16A can partially rescue the phenotype resulting form deletion of Mtc1/Alp14, another XMAP215-like protein. In anaphase, dephosphorylated Dis1 and Dis16A, but not Dis16E, move to the spindle microtubule lattice near the SPBs. Cdc2 thus directly phosphorylates Dis1, and this phosphorylation regulates Dis1 localization in both metaphase and anaphase and ensures high-fidelity segregation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Condensin is a conserved protein complex that functions in chromosome condensation and segregation. It has not been previously unequivocally determined whether condensin is required throughout mitosis. Here, we examined whether Schizosaccharomyces pombe condensin continuously acts on chromosomes during mitosis and compared its role with that of DNA topoisomerase II (Top2). Using double mutants containing a temperature-sensitive allele of the condensin SMC2 subunit cut14 (cut14-208) or of top2, together with the cold-sensitive nda3-KM311 mutation (in $\beta$-tubulin), temperature-shift experiments were performed. These experiments allowed inactivation of condensin or Top2 at various stages throughout mitosis, even after late anaphase. The results established that mitotic chromosomes require condensin and Top2 throughout mitosis, even in telophase. We then showed that the Cnd2 subunit of condensin (also known as Barren) is the target subunit of Aurora-B-like kinase Ark1 and that Ark1-mediated phosphorylation of Cnd2 occurred throughout mitosis. The phosphorylation sites in Cnd2 were determined by mass spectrometry, and alanine and glutamate residue replacement mutant constructs for these sites were constructed. Alanine substitution mutants of Cnd2, which mimic the unphosphorylated protein, exhibited broad mitotic defects, including at telophase, and overexpression of these constructs caused a severe dominantnegative effect. By contrast, glutamate substitution mutants, which mimic the phosphorylated protein, alleviated the segregation defect in Ark1-inhibited cells. In telophase, the condensin subunits in cut14-208 mutant accumulated in lumps that contained telomeric DNA and proteins that failed to segregate. Condensin might thus serve to keep the segregated chromosomes apart during telophase. {\textcopyright} 2011. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

This tradition continues with the new Fifth Edition, which has been completely revised and updated to describe our current, rapidly advancing understanding of cell biology. To list but a few examples, a large amount of new material is presented on epigenetics; stem cells; RNAi; comparative genomics; the latest cancer therapies; apoptosis (now its own separate chapter); and cell cycle control and the mechanics of M phase (now integrated into one chapter).The hallmark features of Molecular Biology of the Cell have been retained, such as its consistent and comprehensive art program, clear concept headings, and succinct section summaries. Additionally, in response to extensive feedback from readers, the Fifth Edition now includes several new features. Most importantly for scientists and researchers, the free Media DVD, which is packaged with every copy of the book, now contains PowerPoint{\textregistered} presentations with all of the figures, tables and micrographs from the book (available as JPEGs too). Also included is the Media Player with over 125 movies—animations, videos, and molecular models—all with voiceover narration. These PowerPoint slides and movies are ideal for presentations and research talks. And for the first time, Molecular Biology of the Cell now contains end-of-chapter questions. These problems, written by John Wilson and Tim Hunt, emphasize a quantitative approach and the art of reasoning from experiments.Molecular Biology of the Cell: Reference Edition is conceptual, accurate and authoritative. An extensive, detailed index provides instant access to the most crucial information and concepts, while a glossary with more than 1,300 entries has been designed for rapid access to technical vocabulary. By skillfully extracting the fundamental concepts from this enormous and ever-growing field, the authors provide the coherent framework needed to effectively access the primary literature.* There is also a student textbook version of Molecular Biology of the Cell, Fifth Edition (ISBN 0-8153-4105-9) that contains Chapters 1-20 in printed format, and Chapters 21-25 only in pdf format on the accompanying DVD-ROM.},

Through whole-mount in situ hybridization, we found that znf219L mRNA is mainly expressed in the zebrafish midbrain-hindbrain boundary, hindbrain, and notochord during development. The znf219L morpholino knockdown caused partial abnormal notochord phenotype and reduced expression of endogenous col2a1a in the notochord specifically. In addition, ZNF219L could recognize binding sites with GGGGG motifs and trigger augmented activity of the col2a1a promoter in a luciferase assay. Furthermore, in vitro binding experiments revealed that ZNF219L recognizes the GGGGG motifs in the promoter region of the zebrafish col2a1a gene through its sixth and ninth zinc finger domains. Taken together, our results reveal that ZNF219L is involved in regulating the expression of col2a1a in zebrafish notochord specifically.},

abstract = {The correct positioning of the nucleus is often important in defining the spatial organization of the cell, for example, in determining the cell division plane. In interphase Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells, the nucleus is positioned in the middle of the cylindrical cell in an active microtubule (MT)-dependent process. Here, we used green fluorescent protein markers to examine the dynamics of MTs, spindle pole body, and the nuclear envelope in living cells. We find that interphase MTs are organized in three to four antiparallel MT bundles arranged along the long axis of the cell, with MT plus ends facing both the cell tips and minus ends near the middle of the cell. The MT bundles are organized from medial MT-organizing centers that may function as nuclear attachment sites. When MTs grow to the cell tips, they exert transient forces produced by plus end MT polymerization that push the nucleus. After an average of 1.5 min of growth at the cell tip, MT plus ends exhibit catastrophe and shrink back to the nuclear region before growing back to the cell tip. Computer modeling suggests that a balance of these pushing MT forces can provide a mechanism to position the nucleus at the middle of the cell.},

abstract = {Spatial regulation of microtubule catastrophe is important for controlling microtubule length and consequently contributes to the proper establishment of cell polarity and cell growth. The +TIP proteins including Tip1/CLIP-170, Klp5/Kinesin-8, and Alp14/XMAP215 reside at microtubule plus ends to regulate microtubule dynamics. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Tip1 and Alp14 serve as microtubule-stabilizing factors, while Klp5 functions oppositely as a catastrophe-promoting factor. Despite that Tip1 has been shown to play a key role in restricting microtubule catastrophe to the cell end, how Tip1 fulfills the role remains to be determined. Employing live-cell microscopy, we showed that the absence of Tip1 impairs the localization of both Klp5 and Alp14 at microtubule plus ends, but the absence of Klp5 prolongs the residence time of Tip1 at microtubule plus ends. We further revealed that Klp5 accumulates behind Tip1 at microtubule plus ends in a Tip1-dependent manner. In addition, artificially tethering Klp5 to microtubule plus ends promotes premature microtubule catastrophe, while tethering Alp14 to microtubule plus ends in the cells lacking Tip1 rescues the phenotype of short microtubules. These findings establish that Tip1 restricts microtubule catastrophe to the cell end likely by spatially restricting the microtubule catastrophe activity of Klp5 and stabilizing Alp14 at microtubule plus ends. Thus, the work demonstrates the orchestration of Tip1, Alp14, and Klp5 in ensuring microtubule catastrophe at the cell end.},

Microtubules are dynamic structures that have periods of both growth and shrinkage by addition and removal of subunits from the polymer [2]. Microtubules stochastically switch between periods of growth and shrinkage, termed dynamic instability [3]. Dynamic instability is coupled to the GTPase activity of the $\beta$-tubulin subunit of the tubulin heterodimer [4]. Microtubule dynamics are regulated by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that interact with microtubules to regulate dynamic instability [5]. MAPs in budding yeast have been identified that bind microtubule ends (Bim1), that stabilize microtubule structures (Stu2), that bundle microtubules by forming cross-bridges (Ase1), and that interact with microtubules at the kinetochore (Cin8, Kar3, Kip3) [6–10]. {\textless}i{\textgreater}IRC15{\textless}/i{\textgreater} was previously identified in four different genetic screens for mutants affecting chromosome transmission or repair [11–14].

While much work has been done to understand the roles of the key force components of the mitotic spindle, identifying the implications of force perturbations in the spindle remains a challenge. We developed a computational framework of the minimal force requirements for mitotic progression and used experimental approaches to further define and validate the model. Through simulations, we show that rather than achieving and maintaining a constant bipolar spindle length, oscillations in pole to pole distance occur that coincide with microtubule binding and force generation by cortical dynein. In the context of high kinesin-14 (HSET) activity, we reveal the requirement of high cortical dynein activity for bipolar spindle formation.},

abstract = {Microtubule assembly from purified tubulin preparations involves both microtubule nucleation and elongation. Whereas elongation is well documented, microtubule nucleation remains poorly understood because of difficulties in isolating molecular intermediates between tubulin dimers and microtubules. Based on kinetic studies, we have previously proposed that the basic building blocks of microtubule nuclei are persistent tubulin oligomers, present at the onset of tubulin assembly. Here we have tested this model directly by isolating nucleation-competent cross-linked tubulin oligomers. We show that such oligomers are composed of 10-15 laterally associated tubulin dimers. In the presence of added free tubulin dimers, several oligomers combine to form microtubule nuclei competent for elongation. We provide evidence that these nuclei have heterogeneous structures, indicating unexpected flexibility in nucleation pathways. Our results suggest that microtubule nucleation in purified tubulin solution is mechanistically similar to that templated by $\gamma$-tubulin ring complexes with the exception that in the absence of $\gamma$-tubulin complexes the production of productive microtubule seeds from tubulin oligomers involves trial and error and a selection process.},

abstract = {Mitosis in eukaryotic cells employs spindle microtubules to drive accurate chromosome segregation at cell division. Cells lacking spindle microtubules arrest in mitosis due to a spindle checkpoint that delays mitotic progression until all chromosomes have achieved stable bipolar attachment to spindle microtubules. In fission yeast, mitosis occurs within an intact nuclear membrane with the mitotic spindle elongating between the spindle pole bodies. We show here that in fission yeast interference with mitotic spindle formation delays mitosis only briefly and cells proceed to an unusual nuclear division process we term nuclear fission, during which cells perform some chromosome segregation and efficiently enter S-phase of the next cell cycle. Nuclear fission is blocked if spindle pole body maturation or sister chromatid separation cannot take place or if actin polymerization is inhibited. We suggest that this process exhibits vestiges of a primitive nuclear division process independent of spindle microtubules, possibly reflecting an evolutionary intermediate state between bacterial and Archeal chromosome segregation where the nucleoid divides without a spindle and a microtubule spindle-based eukaryotic mitosis.},

We found that APC2 localizes as distinct clusters along microtubule bundles in dendrites and that this localization is driven by LC8-binding and two separate microtubule-interacting domains. Depletion of APC2 reduces the plus end dynamics of minus-end-out oriented microtubules, increases microtubule sliding, and causes defects in dendritic morphology. We propose a model in which APC2 regulates dendrite development by promoting dynamics of minus-end-out microtubules.},

In the same area metaphase plates tended to be aligned parallel to the anterior-posterior axis, and statistical analysis showed that rotations of metaphase plates causing preferred orientation were near-complete 8 min before anaphase onset; in some cases, rotations were strikingly rapid, achieving up to 45° per min.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd The unfolded protein response (UPR) is recognized as a key mechanism to promote protein folding and processing in eukaryotes when endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) occurs. Some conditions such as hypoxia or glucose deprivation are factors that may elicit ERS response. Recent literature collectively proposes that ERS response is crucial for mammalian reproduction by allowing decidualization and placentation to occur. However, prolonged ERS and activation of UPR pathways can lead to apoptosis and autophagy, which in turn could pose adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes and placentation. ERS associated pregnancy pathologies include intrauterine growth restriction and early-onset preeclampsia. Given these findings, evidence suggests that overactivation of UPR may lead to harmful reproductive circumstances, whereas physiological regulation of ERS response is essential for mammalian reproduction and placental function. In this review, we discuss the dual role of UPR activation with respect to its contribution to placental development as well as pathologies caused by pathway overactivation. In addition, we suggest potential protein markers associated with the UPR, as circulating C-terminal GRP78 or anti-GRP78 autoantibodies which may prove to be of clinical interest.},

Here, we show that cytoplasmic microtubules are mechanically coupled to the nuclear heterochromatin through proteins embedded in the nuclear envelope. This includes an integral outer nuclear membrane protein of the KASH family (Kms2) and two integral inner nuclear membrane proteins, the SUN-domain protein Sad1 and the previously uncharacterized protein Ima1. Ima1 specifically binds to heterochromatic regions and promotes the tethering of centromeric DNA to the SUN-KASH complex. In the absence of Ima1, or in cells harboring mutations in the centromeric Ndc80 complex, inefficient coupling of centromeric heterochromatin to Sad1 leads to striking defects in the ability of the nucleus to tolerate microtubule-dependent forces, leading to changes in nuclear shape, loss of spindle pole body components from the nuclear envelope, and partial dissociation of SUN-KASH complexes.

abstract = {Proper mitotic chromosome segregation requires dynamic interactions between spindle microtubules and kinetochores. Here we demonstrate that two related fission yeast kinesins, klp5+ and klp6+, are required for normal chromosome segregation in mitosis. Null mutants frequently lack a normal metaphase chromosome alignment. Chromosome pairs move back and forth along the spindle for an extended period prior to sister chromatid separation, a phenotype reminiscent of the loss of CENP-E in metazoans. Ultimately, sister chromatids segregate, regardless of chromosome position along the spindle, and viable daughter cells are usually produced. The initiation of anaphase B is sometimes delayed, but the rate of spindle elongation is similar to wildtype. Despite a delay, anaphase B often begins before anaphase A is completed. The klp5$\Delta$ and klp6$\Delta$ null mutants are synthetically lethal with a deletion of the spindle assembly checkpoint gene, bub1+, several mutants in components of the anaphase promoting complex, and a cold sensitive allele of the kinetochore and microtubule-binding protein, Dis1p. Klp5p-GFP and Klp6p-GFP localize to kinetochores from prophase to the onset of anaphase A, but relocalize to the spindle midzone during anaphase B. These data indicate that Klp5p and Klp6p are kinetochore kinesins required for normal chromosome movement in prometaphase.},

abstract = {The calyx of Held, a large glutamatergic presynaptic terminal in the auditory brainstem undergoes developmental changes to support the high action-potential firing rates required for auditory information encoding. In addition, calyx terminals are morphologically diverse, which impacts vesicle release properties and synaptic plasticity. Mitochondria influence synaptic plasticity through calcium buffering and are crucial for providing the energy required for synaptic transmission. Therefore, it has been postulated that mitochondrial levels increase during development and contribute to the morphological-functional diversity in the mature calyx. However, the developmental profile of mitochondrial volumes and subsynaptic distribution at the calyx of Held remains unclear. To provide insight on this, we developed a helper-dependent adenoviral vector that expresses the genetically encoded peroxidase marker for mitochondria, mitoAPEX2, at the mouse calyx of Held. We developed protocols to detect labeled mitochondria for use with serial block face scanning electron microscopy to carry out semiautomated segmentation of mitochondria, high-throughput whole-terminal reconstruction, and presynaptic ultrastructure in mice of either sex. Subsequently, we measured mitochondrial volumes and subsynaptic distributions at the immature postnatal day (P)7 and the mature (P21) calyx. We found an increase of mitochondria volumes in terminals and axons from P7 to P21 but did not observe differences between stalk and swelling subcompartments in the mature calyx. Based on these findings, we propose that mitochondrial volumes and synaptic localization developmentally increase to support high firing rates required in the initial stages of auditory information processing.},

From the decline in mean fitness and the increase in variance between lines, we estimated a minimum mutation rate to deleterious mutations of 0.005 (+/-0.001 with 95{\%} confidence) and a maximum mean fitness effect per deleterious mutation of 0.03 (+/-0.01 with 95{\%} confidence). We also show that any beneficial mutations that occur during the MA experiment have a small effect on the estimate of the rate and effect of deleterious mutations, unless their rate is extremely large. Extrapolating our results to the wild-type mutation rate, we find that our estimate of the mutational effects is slightly larger and the inferred deleterious mutation rate slightly lower than previous estimates obtained for non-mutator E. coli.},

abstract = {Microtubules are long, proteinaceous filaments that perform structural functions in eukaryotic cells by defining cellular shape and serving as tracks for intracellular motor proteins. We report the first accurate measurements of the flexural rigidity of microtubules. By analyzing the thermally driven fluctuations in their shape, we estimated the mean flexural rigidity of taxol-stabilized microtubules to be 2.2 x 10-23 Nm2 (with 6.4{\%} uncertainty) for seven unlabeled microtubules and 2.1 x 10-23 Nm2 (with 4.7{\%} uncertainty) for eight rhodamine-labeled microtubules. These values are similar to earlier, less precise estimates of microtubule bending stiffness obtained by modeling flagellar motion. A similar analysis on seven rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled actin filaments gave a flexural rigidity of 7.3 x 10-26 Nm2 (with 6{\%} uncertainty), consistent with previously reported results. The flexural rigidity of these microtubules corresponds to a persistence length of 5,200 $\mu$m showing that a microtubule is rigid over cellular dimensions. By contrast, the persistence length of an actin filament is only {\~{}}17.7 $\mu$m, perhaps explaining why actin filaments within cells are usually cross-linked into bundles. The greater flexural rigidity of a microtubule compared to an actin filament mainly derives from the former's larger cross-section. If tubulin were homogeneous and isotropic, then the microtubule's Young's modulus would be {\~{}}1.2 GPa, similar to Plexiglas and rigid plastics. Microtubules are expected to be almost inextensible: the compliance of cells is due primarily to filament bending or sliding between filaments rather than the stretching of the filaments themselves.},

PRC1 has sequence homology to the budding yeast anaphase spindle elongation factor Ase1p. Like Ase1p, PRC1 protein levels are high during S and G2/M and drop dramatically after cells exit mitosis and enter G1. PRC1 is a nuclear protein in interphase, becomes associated with mitotic spindles in a highly dynamic manner during mitosis, and localizes to the cell midbody during cytokinesis. Microinjection of anti-PRC1 antibodies into HeLa cells blocked cellular cleavage, but not nuclear division, indicating a functional role for PRC1 in the process of cytokinesis.},

abstract = {The septation initiation network (SIN) and mitotic exit network (MEN) signaling pathways regulate cytokinesis and mitotic exit in the yeasts Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. One function of these pathways is to keep the Cdc14-family phosphatase, called Clp1 in S. pombe, from being sequestered and inhibited in the nucleolus. In S. pombe, the SIN and Clp1 act as part of a cytokinesis checkpoint that allows cells to cope with cytokinesis defects. The SIN promotes checkpoint function by 1) keeping Clp1 out of the nucleolus, 2) maintaining the cytokinetic apparatus, and 3) halting the cell cycle until cytokinesis is completed. In a screen for suppressors of the SIN mutant cytokinesis checkpoint defect, we identified a novel nucleolar protein called Dnt1 and other nucleolar proteins, including Rrn5 and Nuc1, which are known to be required for rDNA transcription. Dnt1 shows sequence homology to Net1/Cfi1, which encodes the nucleolar inhibitor of Cdc14 in budding yeast. Like Net1/Cfi1, Dnt1 is required for rDNA silencing and minichromosome maintenance, and both Dnt1 and Net1/Cfi1 negatively regulate the homologous SIN and MEN pathways. Unlike Net1/Cfi1, which regulates the MEN through the Cdc14 phosphatase, Dnt1 can inhibit SIN signaling independently of Clp1, suggesting a novel connection between the nucleolus and the SIN pathway. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The American Society for Cell Biology.},

abstract = {During vegetative growth, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells divide asymmetrically: the mother cell buds to produce a smaller daughter cell. This daughter asymmetrically inherits the transcription factor Ace2, which activates daughter-specific transcriptional programs. In this paper, we investigate when and how this asymmetry is established and maintained. We show that Ace2 asymmetry is initiated in the elongated, but undivided, anaphase nucleus. At this stage, the nucleoplasm was highly compartmentalized; little exchange was observed for nucleoplasmic proteins between mother and bud. Using photobleaching and in silico modeling, we show that diffusion barriers compartmentalize the nuclear membranes. In contrast, the behavior of proteins in the nucleoplasm is well explained by the dumbbell shape of the anaphase nucleus. This compartmentalization of the nucleoplasm promoted Ace2 asymmetry in anaphase nuclei. Thus, our data indicate that yeast cells use the process of closed mitosis and the morphological constraints associated with it to asymmetrically segregate nucleoplasmic components. {\textcopyright} 2012 Boettcher et al.},

A number of structural studies of $\alpha$$\beta$-tubulin, $\gamma$-tubulin (the isoform involved in microtubule nucleation), FtsZ and bacterial tubulin, in a variety of nucleotide and polymerization states, have been reported in the past few years. These studies have revealed the similarities and differences between these structures and their possible functional implications. In particular, a two-state mechanism has been proposed for the recycling of $\alpha$$\beta$-tubulin during the microtubule disassembly-assembly cycle; this mechanism may be unique to eukaryotic dimeric tubulin and the microtubule structure. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Gastrulation shapes the early embryos by forming three germ layers, ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. In vertebrates, this process requires massive cell rearrangement including convergence and extension (CE) movements that involve narrowing and lengthening of embryonic tissues as well as cell elongation. Such polarization and movements require precise reorganization and regulation of the cytoskeleton network and cell adhesion. Rho small GTPases are key regulators for dynamic actin cytoskeleton. However, the signaling mechanisms underlying their functions in CE remain to be further elucidated. We have cloned the zebrafish Danio rerio rhoA and by capitalizing on the specific functional knockdown using morpholinos against rhoA and the availability of CE mutants defective in Wnt signaling, we showed that rhoA morphants were reminiscent to noncanonical wnt mutants with serious disruption in CE movements. Injection of rhoA mRNA effectively rescued such defects in wnt5 and wnt11 mutants. Furthermore, CE defects in rhoA knockdown or wnt mutants can be suppressed through functional bypass after ectopic expression of the two mammalian Rho effectors, the Rho kinase and Diaphanous (mDia). These results provide the first evidence that the RhoA in vivo acts downstream of Wnt5 and Wnt11 to effect, without affecting cell fates, on the CE movements in zebrafish embryos. Significantly, it elicits such effect via both effectors, Rho kinase and Dia. These findings also support the versatility of the zebrafish as a model to further investigate the roles of various classes of small GTPases in regulating cell dynamics in vivo.},

abstract = {Antiparallel microtubule bundles are essential structural elements of many cytoskeletal structures, for instance, the mitotic spindle. Sliding of microtubules relative to each other can lead to an overall elongation of the bundle. However, such sliding must be accompanied by microtubule growth, to maintain the overlap, which is a landmark of anaphase. Diffusive crosslinkers of the Ase1/PRC1/MAP65 family are able to form stable overlaps in combination with kinesin-14 motors. This process is thought to arise through a balance of forces between motors and crosslinkers, the latter effectively producing an entropic pressure. We provide a continuous theory to explain the formation of stable overlaps, in which steric effects caused by the finite number of binding sites available on the microtubule lattice play a leading role. We confirmed the validity of this approach using discrete stochastic simulations performed with the Open Source simulation engine Cytosim. From the densities of motors and crosslinkers, their diffusion rates, and the velocities of motors, the theory predicts the sliding speed of microtubules and explains the force production and breaking effect of crosslinkers and motors containing diffusible microtubule-binding domains. Finally, we discuss a mechanism by which sliding and microtubule growth can be coordinated without the need for fine-tuning the parameters of the system, in line with the known robustness of mitosis.},

abstract = {An effective theory is formulated for the dynamics of the guanosine triphosphate (GTP) cap believed to stabilize growing microtubules. The theory provides a ‘coarse-grained' description of the cap's dynamics. ‘Microscopic' details, such as the microtubule lattice structure and the fate of its individual tubulin dimers, are ignored. In this cap model, GTP hydrolysis is assumed to be stochastic and uncoupled to microtubule growth. Different rates of hydrolysis are assumed for GTP in the cap's interior and for GTP at its boundary with hydrolyzed parts of the microtubule. Expectation values and probability distributions relating to available experimental data are derived. Caps are found to be short and the total rate of hydrolysis at a microtubule end is found to be dynamically coupled to growth. The so-called catastrophe rate is a simple function of the microtubule growth rate and fits experimental data. A constant nonzero catastrophe rate, identical for both microtubule ends, is predicted at large growth rates. The delay time for dilution-induced catastrophes is stochastic with a simple distribution that fits the experimental one and, like the experimental one, does not depend on the rate of microtubule growth before dilution. The GTP content of microtubules is found and its rate of hydrolysis is determined under the circumstances created in an experiment designed to measure this GTP content. It is concluded that this experiment's failure to register any GTP content is consistent with the model. A recent experimental result for the size of the minimal cap that can stabilize a microtubule is shown to agree with the result predicted by the cap model, after its parameters have been extracted from previous experimental results. Thus the effective theory and cap model presented here provide a unified description of several apparently contradictory experimental data. Experimental results for the catastrophe rate at different concentrations of magnesium ions and of microtubule associated proteins are discussed in terms of the model. Feasible experiments are suggested that can provide decisive tests of the model and determine its three parameters with higher precision. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Microtubules in the mitotic spindle are organised by microtubule-associated proteins. In the late stage of mitosis, spindle microtubules are robustly organised through bundling by the antiparallel microtubule bundler Ase1/PRC1. In early mitosis, however, it is not well characterised as to whether spindle microtubules are actively bundled, as Ase1 does not particularly localise to the spindle at that stage. Here we show that the conserved microtubule-associated protein CLASP (fission yeast Peg1/Cls1) facilitates bundling of spindle microtubules in early mitosis. The peg1 mutant displayed a fragile spindle with unbundled microtubules, which eventually resulted in collapse of the metaphase spindle and abnormal segregation of chromosomes. Peg1 is known to be recruited to the spindle by Ase1 to stabilise antiparallel microtubules in late mitosis. However, we demonstrate that the function of Peg1 in early mitosis does not rely on Ase1. The unbundled spindle phenotype of the peg1 mutant was not seen in the ase1 mutant, and Peg1 preferentially localised to the spindle even in early mitosis unlike Ase1. Moreover, artificial overexpression of Ase1 in the peg1 mutant partially suppressed unbundled microtubules. We thus conclude that Peg1 bundles microtubules in early mitosis, in a distinct manner from its conventional Ase1-dependent functions in other cell cycle stages.},

abstract = {The separation of sister chromatids in anaphase is followed by spindle disassembly and cytokinesis. These events are governed by the anaphase- promoting complex (APC), which triggers the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of key regulatory proteins: anaphase requires the destruction of the anaphase inhibitor Pds1, whereas mitotic exit requires the destruction of mitotic cyclins and the inactivation of Cdk1. We find that Pds1 is not only an inhibitor of anaphase, but also blocks cyclin destruction and mitotic exit by a mechanism independent of its effects on sister chromatid separation. Pds1 is also required for the mitotic arrest and inhibition of cyclin destruction that occurs after DNA damage. Even in anaphase cells, where Pds1 levels are normally low, DNA damage stabilizes Pds1 and prevents cyclin destruction and mitotic exit. Pds1 blocks cyclin destruction by inhibiting its binding partner Esp1. Mutations in ESP1 delay cyclin destruction; overexpression of ESP1 causes premature cyclin destruction in cells arrested in metaphase by spindle defects and in cells arrested in metaphase and anaphase by DNA damage. The effects of Esp1 are dependent on Cdc20 (an activating subunit of the APC) and on several additional proteins (Cdc5, Cdc14, Cdc15, Tem1) that form a regulatory network governing mitotic exit. We speculate that the inhibition of cyclin destruction by Pds1 may contribute to the ordering of late mitotic events by ensuring that mitotic exit is delayed until after anaphase is initiated. In addition, the stabilization of Pds1 after DNA damage provides a mechanism to delay both anaphase and mitotic exit while DNA repair occurs.},

Microtubule bundles can either push or restrict chromosome movement during anaphase in different cellular contexts, but how these activities are achieved remains poorly understood. Here, we use high-resolution live-cell imaging to analyze individual microtubule bundles, growing filaments, and chromosome movement in dividing human cells. Within bundles, filament overlap length marked by the cross-linking protein PRC1 decreases during anaphase as chromosome segregation slows. Filament ends within microtubule bundles appear capped despite dynamic PRC1 turnover and submicrometer proximity to growing microtubules. Chromosome segregation distance and rate are increased in two human cell lines when microtubule bundle assembly is prevented via PRC1 knockdown. Upon expressing a mutant PRC1 with reduced microtubule affinity, bundles assemble but chromosome hypersegregation is still observed. We propose that microtubule overlap length reduction, typically linked to pushing forces generated within filament bundles, is needed to properly restrict spindle elongation and position chromosomes within daughter cells.},

This "poleward flux" of microtubules occurs in many organisms and may provide part of the force for chromosome segregation. We use quantitative image analysis to examine the role of the kinesin Eg5 in poleward flux in metaphase Xenopus laevis egg extract spindles. Pharmacological inhibition of Eg5 results in a dose-responsive slowing of flux, and biochemical depletion of Eg5 significantly decreases the flux rate. Our results suggest that ensembles of nonprocessive Eg5 motors drive flux in metaphase Xenopus extract spindles.},

abstract = {The Ndc80 complex, a conserved outer kinetochore complex, comprising four components (Ndc80/Hec1, Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc25), constitutes one of the core microtubule-binding sites within the kinetochore [1-3]. Despite this knowledge, molecular mechanisms by which this complex contributes to establishment of correct bipolar attachment of the kinetochore to the spindle microtubule remain largely elusive [1, 2, 4, 5]. Here we show that the conserved internal loop [6, 7] of fission yeast Ndc80 directly binds the Dis1/TOG microtubule-associated protein [8-10], thereby coupling spindle microtubule dynamics with kinetochore capture. Ndc80 loop mutant proteins fail to recruit Dis1 to kinetochores, imposing unstable attachment and frequent spindle collapse. In these mutants, mitotic progression is halted attributable to spindle assembly checkpoint activation, and chromosomes remain in the vicinity of the spindle poles without congression. dis1 deletion precisely phenocopies the loop mutants. Intriguingly, forced targeting of Dis1 to the Ndc80 complex rescues loop mutant's defects. We propose that Ndc80 comprises two microtubule-interacting interfaces: the N-terminal region directly binds the microtubule lattice, while the internal loop interacts with the plus end of microtubules via Dis1/TOG. Therefore, our results provide a crucial insight into how the Ndc80 complex establishes stable bipolar attachment to the spindle microtubule. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In particular, it focuses on specific adaptations such as montage imaging in the plane of each section and the acquisition of serial tomograms that can be joined to encompass the full cell volume including its MT bundles. A new screening method is introduced in the chapter that helps in finding organelles of interest, even when they are not visible in single images of the thick sections. It also gives instructions for constructing precise three-dimensional (3D) models with the IMOD software package, with particular emphasis on the representation of microtubular elements. The chapter illustrates the ways IMOD can be used efficiently to perform the quantitative analysis of the subcellular elements depicted in the 3D models. It provides a guiding frame for investigating particular cell features that should be understood as 3D structures viewed with good resolution within large volumes in cells.},
annote = {What is the the difference with EM that uses thin sections? 
The sections are thinner in the old serial thick sections, while here they take thicker ones and they tilt them. This is good for the MTs in yeast cells, since they are not necessarily straight and therefore serial sections are harder to concatenate.
Also this method provides isotropic resolution (unlike the serial sectioning which is limited in z by the thickness of the sections)

Pipeline:
1. Choose from a big field the cells that are better alligned in the field
2. Do a pre-reconstruction to find those cells with the MTs the most paralel to the axis as possible.
3. Go for a more detailed reconstruction

Take-home message:
This shrinkage might be worth being considered when using the data measured here for the model. For the MTs, a way to prevent this proble is to try to get a cell with the MTs paralel to the plane of section},

abstract = {Specification of unequal daughter cell fates in the Drosophila external sense organ lineage requires asymmetric localization of the intrinsic determinant Numb as well as cell-cell interactions mediated by the Delta ligand and Notch receptor. Previous genetic studies indicated that numb acts upstream of Notch, and biochemical studies revealed that Numb can bind Notch. For a functional assay of the action of Numb on Notch signaling, we expressed these proteins in cultured Drosophila cells and used nuclear translocation of Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] as a reporter for Notch activity. We found that Numb interfered with the ability of Notch to cause nuclear translocation of Su(H); both the C-terminal half of the phosphotyrosine binding domain and the C terminus of Numb are required to inhibit Notch. Overexpression of Numb during wing development, which is sensitive to Notch dosage, revealed that Numb is also able to inhibit the Notch receptor in vivo. In the external sense organ lineage, the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Numb was found to be essential for the function but not for asymmetric localization of Numb. Our results suggest that Numb determines daughter cell fates in the external sense organ lineage by inhibiting Notch signaling.},

Although gastrulation is known to be regulated by signaling pathways such as the Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway, many questions remain about the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. Key factors that may play a role in gastrulation cell movements are cell adhesion and cytoskeletal rearrangement. In addition, some of the driving force for gastrulation may derive from tissue interactions such as those described between the enveloping layer and the yolk syncytial layer. Future exploration of gastrulation mechanisms relies on the development of sensitive and quantitative techniques to characterize embryonic germ-layer properties.},

abstract = {The yeast spindle pole body (SPB) is the functional equivalent of the mammalian centrosome. Centrosomes and SPBs duplicate exactly once per cell cycle by mechanisms that use the mother structure as a platform for the assembly of the daughter. The conserved Sfi1 and centrin proteins are essential components of the SPB duplication process. Sfi1 is an elongated molecule that has, in its center, 20 to 23 binding sites for the Ca(2+)-binding protein centrin. In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, all Sfi1 N termini are in contact with the mother SPB whereas the free C termini are distal to it. During S phase and early mitosis, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) phosphorylation of mainly serine residues in the Sfi1 C termini blocks the initiation of SPB duplication ("off" state). Upon anaphase onset, the phosphatase Cdc14 dephosphorylates Sfi1 ("on" state) to promote antiparallel and shifted incorporation of cytoplasmic Sfi1 molecules into the half-bridge layer, which thereby elongates into the bridge. The Sfi1 C termini of the two Sfi1 layers localize in the bridge center, whereas the N termini of the newly assembled Sfi1 molecules are distal to the mother SPB. These free Sfi1 N termini then assemble the new SPB in G1phase. Recruitment of Sfi1 molecules into the anaphase SPB and bridge formation were also observed inSchizosaccharomyces pombe, suggesting that the Sfi1 bridge cycle is conserved between the two organisms. Thus, restricting SPB duplication to one event per cell cycle requires only an oscillation between Cdk1 kinase and Cdc14 phosphatase activities. This clockwork regulates the "on"/"off" state of the Sfi1-centrin receiver.},

These MAPs are enriched at the spindle midzone in yeast and mammals and at the fragmoplast in plants, and are essential for the organization and function of these microtubule arrays [1-5]. Here we show that the Feo protein is specifically enriched at the central-spindle midzone and that its depletion either by mutation or by RNAi results in aberrant central spindles. In Feo-depleted cells, late anaphases showed normal overlap of the antiparallel MTs at the cell equator, but telophases displayed thin MT bundles of uniform width instead of robust hourglass-shaped central spindles. These thin central spindles exhibited diffuse localizations of both the Pav and Asp proteins, suggesting that these spindles comprise improperly oriented MTs. Feo-depleted cells also displayed defects in the contractile apparatus that correlated with those in the central spindle; late anaphase cells formed regular contractile structures, but these structures did not constrict during telophase, leading to failures in cytokinesis. The phenotype of Feo-depleted telophases suggests that Feo interacts with the plus ends of central spindle MTs so as to maintain their precise interdigitation during anaphase-telophase MT elongation and antiparallel sliding.},

abstract = {We investigate the microtubule polymerization dynamics with catastrophe and rescue events for three different confinement scenarios, which mimic typical cellular environments: (i) The microtubule is confined by rigid and fixed walls, (ii) it grows under constant force, and (iii) it grows against an elastic obstacle with a linearly increasing force. We use realistic catastrophe models and analyze the microtubule dynamics, the resulting microtubule length distributions, and force generation by stochastic and mean field calculations; in addition, we perform stochastic simulations. Freely growing microtubules exhibit a phase of bounded growth with finite microtubule length and a phase of unbounded growth. The main results for the three confinement scenarios are as follows: (i) In confinement by fixed rigid walls, we find exponentially decreasing or increasing stationary microtubule length distributions instead of bounded or unbounded phases, respectively. We introduce a realistic model for wall-induced catastrophes and investigate the behavior of the average length as a function of microtubule growth parameters. (ii) Under a constant force, the boundary between bounded and unbounded growth is shifted to higher tubulin concentrations and rescue rates. The critical force f c for the transition from unbounded to bounded growth increases logarithmically with tubulin concentration and the rescue rate, and it is smaller than the stall force. (iii) For microtubule growth against an elastic obstacle, the microtubule length and polymerization force can be regulated by microtubule growth parameters. For zero rescue rate, we find that the average polymerization force depends logarithmically on the tubulin concentration and is always smaller than the stall force in the absence of catastrophes and rescues. For a nonzero rescue rate, we find a sharply peaked steady-state length distribution, which is tightly controlled by microtubule growth parameters. The corresponding average microtubule length self-organizes such that the average polymerization force equals the critical force f c for the transition from unbounded to bounded growth. We also investigate the force dynamics if growth parameters are perturbed in dilution experiments. Finally, we show the robustness of our results against changes of catastrophe models and load distribution factors. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

Two conserved families of microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins, the XMAP215, ch-TOG or CKAP5 family and the end-binding 1 (EB1, also known as MAPRE1) family, play pivotal roles in regulating microtubule dynamics. Here, we study the functional interplay between fission yeast Dis1, a member of the XMAP215/TOG family, and Mal3, an EB1 protein. Using an in vitro microscopy assay, we find that purified Dis1 autonomously tracks growing microtubule ends and is a bona fide microtubule polymerase. Mal3 recruits additional Dis1 to microtubule ends, explaining the synergistic enhancement of microtubule dynamicity by these proteins. A non-canonical binding motif in Dis1 mediates the interaction with Mal3. X-ray crystallography shows that this new motif interacts in an unconventional configuration with the conserved hydrophobic cavity formed within the Mal3 C-terminal region that typically interacts with the canonical SXIP motif. Selectively perturbing the Mal3–Dis1 interaction in living cells demonstrates that it is important for accurate chromosome segregation. Whereas, in some metazoans, the interaction between EB1 and the XMAP215/TOG family members requires an additional binding partner, fission yeast relies on a direct interaction, indicating evolutionary plasticity of this critical interaction module.},

At low speeds and with no energy source, the frictional drag was related to the diffusion coefficient by the Einstein relation. At higher speeds, the frictional drag force increased nonlinearly, consistent with the motor jumping 8 nanometers between adjacent tubulin dimers along the microtubule, and was asymmetric, reflecting the structural polarity of the microtubule. We argue that these frictional forces arise from breaking bonds between the motor domains and the microtubule, and they limit the speed and efficiency of kinesin.},

The SRPK (SR protein-specific kinase) family performs highly conserved functions in eukaryotic cells including cell proliferation, differentiation, development, and apoptosis. Although Dsk1 was originally identified as a mitotic regulator, its specific targets involved in cell cycle have yet been unexplored. In this study, using a phosphoproteomics approach, we examined differential protein phosphorylation between wild-type cells and dsk1-deletion mutants. We found reduced phosphorylation of 149 peptides corresponding to 133 proteins in the dsk1-null cells. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeleton organization and signal transduction, and specifically enriched in multiple steps of cell cycle control. Further, targeted MS analyses and in vitro biochemical assays established Cdr2 protein kinase and kinesin motor Klp9 as novel substrates of Dsk1, which function in cell size control for mitotic entry and in chromosome segregation for mitotic exit, respectively. The phosphoprotein networks mediated by Dsk1 reveal, for the first time, the molecular links connecting Dsk1 to mitotic phase transition, sister-chromatid segregation, and cytokinesis, providing further evidence of Dsk1's diverse influence on cell cycle progression and regulation.},

The conserved Msd1/SSX2IP proteins are localized to the spindle pole body (SPB) and the centrosome in fission yeast and humans, respectively, and play a critical role in microtubule anchoring. In this paper, we show that fission yeast Msd1 forms a ternary complex with another conserved protein, Wdr8, and the minus end–directed Pkl1/kinesin-14. Individual deletion mutants displayed the identical spindle-protrusion phenotypes. Msd1 and Wdr8 were delivered by Pkl1 to mitotic SPBs, where Pkl1 was tethered through Msd1–Wdr8. The spindle-anchoring defect imposed by msd1/wdr8/pkl1 deletions was suppressed by a mutation of the plus end–directed Cut7/kinesin-5, which was shown to be mutual. Intriguingly, Pkl1 motor activity was not required for its anchoring role once targeted to the SPB. Therefore, spindle anchoring through Msd1–Wdr8–Pkl1 is crucial for balancing the Cut7/kinesin-5–mediated outward force at the SPB. Our analysis provides mechanistic insight into the spatiotemporal regulation of two opposing kinesins to ensure mitotic spindle bipolarity.},

We have cloned a complete cDNA of Dictyostelium EB1 (DdEB1), the largest known EB1 homolog (57 kDa). Immunofluorescence analysis and expression of a green fluorescent protein-DdEB1 fusion protein revealed that DdEB1 localizes along microtubules, at microtubule tips, centrosomes, and protruding pseudopods. During mitosis, it was found at the spindle, spindle poles, and kinetochores. DdEB1 is the first EB1-homolog that is also a genuine centrosomal component, because it was localized at isolated centrosomes that are free of microtubules. Furthermore, centrosomal DdEB1 distribution was unaffected by nocodazole treatment. DdEB1 colocalized with DdCP224, the XMAP215 homolog, at microtubule tips, the centrosome, and kinetochores. Furthermore, both proteins were part of the same cytosolic protein complex, suggesting that they may act together in their functions. DdEB1 deletion mutants expressed as green fluorescent protein or maltose-binding fusion proteins indicated that microtubule binding requires homo-oligomerization, which is mediated by a coiled-coil domain. A DdEB1 null mutant was viable but retarded in prometaphase progression due to a defect in spindle formation. Because spindle elongation was normal, DdEB1 seems to be required for the initiation of the outgrowth of spindle microtubules.},

abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Summary{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Microtubule (MT) crosslinking proteins of the ase1p/PRC1/Map65 family play a major role in the construction of MT networks such as the mitotic spindle. Most homologs in this family have been shown to localize with a remarkable specificity to sets of MTs that overlap with an antiparallel relative orientation [1–4]. Regulatory proteins bind to ase1p/PRC1/Map65 and appear to use the localization to set up precise spatial signals [5–10]. Here, we present evidence for a mechanism of localized protein multimerization underlying the specific targeting of ase1p, the fision yeast homolog. In controlled in vitro experiments, dimers of ase1-GFP diffused along the surface of single MTs and, at concentrations above a certain threshold, assembled into static multimeric structures. We observed that this threshold was significantly lower on overlapping MTs. We also observed diffusion and multimerization of ase1-GFP on MTs inside living cells, suggesting that a multimerization-driven localization mechanism is relevant in vivo. The domains responsible for MT binding and multimerization were identified via a series of ase1p truncations. Our findings show that cells use a finely tuned cooperative localization mechanism that exploits differences in the geometry and concentration of ase1p binding sites along single and overlapping MTs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Studies of outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) are hampered by the lack of robust injury severity measures that can accommodate spatial-anatomical and mechanistic heterogeneity. In this study we introduce a Mahalanobis distance measure (M) as an intrinsic injury severity measure that combines in a single score the many ways a given injured brain's connectivity can vary from that of healthy controls. Our objective is to test the hypotheses that M is superior to univariate measures in (1) discriminating patients and controls and (2) correlating with cognitive assessment. METHODS: Sixty-five participants (34 with mild TBI, 31 controls) underwent diffusion tensor MRI and extensive neuropsychological testing. Structural connectivity was inferred for all participants for 22 major white matter connections. Twenty-two univariate measures (1 per connection) and 1 multivariate measure (M), capturing and summarizing all connectivity change in a single score, were computed. RESULTS: Our multivariate measure (M) was able to better discriminate between patients and controls (area under the curve 0.81) than any individual univariate measure. M significantly correlated with cognitive outcome (Spearman $\rho$ = 0.31; p {\textless} 0.05). No univariate measure showed significant correlation after correction for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity in the severity and distribution of injuries after TBI has traditionally complicated the understanding of outcomes after TBI. Our approach provides a single, continuous variable that can fully capture individual heterogeneity. M's ability to distinguish even mildly injured patients from controls and its correlation with cognitive assessment suggest utility as an imaging-based marker of intrinsic injury severity.},

abstract = {The Ase1/Prc1 proteins constitute a conserved microtubule-associated protein family that is implicated in central spindle formation and cytokinesis. Here we characterize a role for fission yeast Ase1. Ase1 localizes to microtubule overlapping zones and displays dynamic alterations of localization during the cell cycle. In particular, its spindle localization during metaphase is reduced substantially, followed by robust appearance at the spindle midzone in anaphase. ase1 deletions are viable but defective in nuclear and septum positioning and completion of cytokinesis, which leads to diploidization and chromosome loss. Time-lapse imaging shows that elongating spindles collapse abruptly in the middle of anaphase B. Either absence or overproduction of Ase1 results in profound defects on microtubule bundling in an opposed manner, indicating that Ase1 is a dose-dependent microtubule-bundling factor. In contrast microtubule nucleating activities are not noticeably compromised in ase1 mutants. During meiosis astral microtubules are not bundled and oscillatory nuclear movement is impaired significantly. The Aurora kinase does not correctly localize to central spindles in the absence of Ase1. Finally Ase1 acts as a regulatory component in the cytokinesis checkpoint that operates to inhibit nuclear division when the cytokinesis apparatus is perturbed. Ase1, therefore, couples anaphase completion with cytokinesis upon cell division.},

abstract = {Chromosome condensation is a major mitotic event [1]. Fission yeast mutations in topoisomerase II and condensin subunits produce the characteristic 'cut' phenotypes, in which the septum bisects the nuclear material in the absence of normal condensation and sister chromatid separation [2]. We show here that the same condensation defect is produced in cut15 temperature-sensitive mutants at the restrictive temperature (36°C). The gene product of cut15+ is, surprisingly, very similar to importin $\alpha$ [3,4], which binds proteins containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and forms the heterodimer with importin $\beta$ that mediates translocation through the nuclear pore complex [5]. We show that in a nuclear import assay, purified Cut15 protein behaved identically to mammalian importin $\alpha$ but mutant Cut15 did not. Mutant Cut15 failed to bind an NLS-containing protein in vitro but could still bind importin $\beta$. Unexpectedly, however, NLS proteins were imported into the nucleus in cut15 mutants. Cut15 is thus essential for mitotic chromosome condensation, but its role in nuclear import might be dispensable. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Cut15 was enriched within the nucleus specifically during prometaphase-metaphase, so the interaction of Cut15 with nuclear NLS proteins during mitosis might be important for condensation.},

abstract = {During metaphase, chromosome position at the spindle equator is mainly regulated by the forces exerted by kinetochore microtubules. However, the role of forces arising from mechanical coupling between sister k-fibers and bridging fibers, whose antiparallel microtubules are crosslinked by protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (PRC1), in chromosome alignment is unknown. Here we develop an optogenetic approach for acute removal of PRC1 and show that PRC1 promotes kinetochore alignment. PRC1 removal resulted in reduction of bridging fibers and straightening of outermost kinetochore fibers. The inter-kinetochore distance decreased, the metaphase plate widened, and lagging kinetochores appeared, suggesting the role of PRC1 in regulating forces on kinetochores. MKLP1/kinesin-6 was lost from the spindle together with PRC1, whereas Kif4A/kinesin-4 remained on chromosomes and CLASP1, Kif18A, and CENP-E on the ends of kinetochore fibers. In conclusion, our optogenetic experiments indicate that in metaphase PRC1, by mechanically coupling bridging and kinetochore fibers, regulates spindle mechanics and forces acting on kinetochores, promoting kinetochore alignment.},

abstract = {Mal3 is a fission yeast homolog of EB1, a plus-end tracking protein (+. TIP). We have generated a mutation (89R) replacing glutamine with arginine in the calponin homology (CH) domain of Mal3. Analysis of the 89R mutant. in vitro has revealed that the mutation confers a higher affinity to microtubules and enhances the intrinsic activity to promote the microtubule-assembly. The mutant Mal3 is no longer a +. TIP, but binds strongly the microtubule lattice. Live cell imaging has revealed that while the wild type Mal3 proteins dissociate from the tip of the growing microtubules before the onset of shrinkage, the mutant Mal3 proteins persist on microtubules and reduces a rate of shrinkage after a longer pausing period. Consequently, the mutant Mal3 proteins cause abnormal elongation of microtubules composing the spindle and aster. Mal3 is phosphorylated at a cluster of serine/threonine residues in the linker connecting the CH and EB1-like C-terminal motif domains. The phosphorylation occurs in a microtubule-dependent manner and reduces the affinity of Mal3 to microtubules. We propose that because the 89R mutation is resistant to the effect of phosphorylation, it can associate persistently with microtubules and confers a stronger stability of microtubules likely by reinforcing the cylindrical structure. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {Anaphase B in Drosophila embryos is initiated by the inhibition of microtubule (MT) depolymerization at spindle poles, which allows outwardly sliding interpolar (ip) MTs to drive pole-pole separation. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we observed that MTs throughout the preanaphase B spindle are very dynamic and display complete recovery of fluorescence, but during anaphase B, MTs proximal to the poles stabilize and therefore display lower recovery than those elsewhere. Fluorescence microscopy of the MT tip tracker EB1 revealed that growing MT plus ends localize throughout the preanaphase B spindle but concentrate in the overlap region of interpolar MTs (ipMTs) at anaphase B onset. None of these changes occurred in the presence of nondegradable cyclin B. Modeling suggests that they depend on the establishment of a spatial gradient of MT plus-end catastrophe frequencies, decreasing toward the equator. The resulting redistribution of ipMT plus ends to the overlap zone, together with the suppression of minus-end depolymerization at the poles, could constitute a mechanical switch that initiates spindle elongation.},

It remains poorly understood how these functions arise from tubulin recruitment, mediated by the distinct TOG1 and TOG2 domains, or the assembly of these arrays into large square complexes. Here, we describe a relationship between MT plus-end tracking and polymerase functions revealing their distinct origin within TOG arrays. We study Alp14 mutants designed based on structural models, with defects in either tubulin recruitment or self-organization. Using in vivo live imaging in fission yeast and in vitro MT dynamics assays, we show that tubulins recruited by TOG1 and TOG2 serve concerted, yet distinct, roles in MT plus-end tracking and polymerase functions. TOG1 is critical for processive plus-end tracking, whereas TOG2 is critical for accelerating tubulin polymerization. Inactivating interfaces that stabilize square complexes lead to defects in both processive MT plus-end tracking and polymerase. Our studies suggest that a dynamic cycle between square and unfurled TOG array states gives rise to processive polymerase activity at MT plus ends.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Microtubules (MTs) are highly dynamical structures that play a crucial role in cell physiology. In cooperation with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), MTs form bundles endowing cells with specific mechanisms to control their shape or generate forces. Whether the dynamics of MTs is affected by the lateral connections that MAPs make between MTs during bundle formation is still under debate. Using in vitro reconstitution of MT bundling, we analyzed the dynamics of MT bundles generated by two plant MAP65 (MAP65-1/4), MAP65-1 being the plant ortholog of vertebrate PRC1 and yeast Ase1. MAP65-1/4 limit the amplitude of MT bundle depolymerization and increase the elongation phases. The subsequent sustained elongation of bundles is governed by the coordination of MT growth, so that MT ends come in close vicinity. We develop a model based on the assumption that both MAP65-1/4 block MT depolymerization. Model simulations reveal that rescue frequencies are higher between parallel than between anti-parallel MTs. In consequence the polarity of bundled MTs by MAP65 controls the amplitude of bundle's growth. Our results illustrate how MAP-induced MT-bundling, which is finely tuned by MT polarity, robustly coordinates MT elongation within bundles.},

abstract = {Background: CLIP-170 and EB1 protein family members localize to growing microtubule tips and link spatial information with the control of microtubule dynamics. It is unknown whether these proteins operate independently or whether their actions are coordinated. In fission yeast the CLIP-170 homolog tip1p is required for targeting of microtubules to cell ends, whereas the role of the EB1 homolog mal3p in microtubule organization has not been investigated. Results: We show that mal3p promotes the initiation of microtubule growth and inhibits catastrophes. Premature catastrophes occur randomly throughout the cell in the absence of mal3p. mal3p decorates the entire microtubule lattice and localizes to particles along the microtubules and at their growing tips. Particles move in two directions, outbound toward the cell ends or inbound toward the cell center. At cell ends, the microtubule tip-associated mal3p particles disappear followed by a catastrophe. mal3p localizes normally in tip1-deleted cells and disappears from microtubule tips preceding the premature catastrophes. In contrast, tip1p requires mal3p to localize at microtubule tips. mal3p and tip1p directly interact in vitro. Conclusions: mal3p and tip1p form a system allowing microtubules to target cell ends. We propose that mal3p stimulates growth initiation and maintains growth by suppressing catastrophes. At cell ends, mal3p disappears from microtubule tips followed by a catastrophe. mal3p is involved in recruiting tip1p to microtubule tips. This becomes important when microtubules contact the cell cortex outside the cell ends because mal3p dissociates prematurely without tip1p, which is followed by a premature catastrophe.},

abstract = {Microtubules (MTs) are dynamic protein polymers that change their length by switching between growing and shrinking states in a process termed dynamic instability. It has been suggested that the dynamic properties of MTs are central to the organization of the eukaryotic intracellular space, and that they are involved in the control of cell morphology, but the actual mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we present a theoretical analysis in which we explore the possibility that a system of dynamic MTs and MT end-tracking molecular motors is providing specific positional information inside cells. We compute the MT length distribution for the case of MT-length-dependent switching between growing and shrinking states, and analyze the accumulation of molecular motors at the tips of growing MTs. Using these results, we show that a transport system consisting of dynamic MTs and associated motor proteins can deliver cargo proteins preferentially to specific positions within the cell. Comparing our results with experimental data in the model organism fission yeast, we propose that the suggested mechanisms could play important roles in setting length scales during cellular morphogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {A key question in understanding microtubule dynamics is how GTP hydrolysis leads to catastrophe, the switch from slow growth to rapid shrinkage. We first provide a review of the experimental and modeling literature, and then present a new model of microtubule dynamics. We demonstrate that vectorial, random, and coupled hydrolysis mechanisms are not consistent with the dependence of catastrophe on tubulin concentration and show that, although single-protofilament models can explain many features of dynamics, they do not describe catastrophe as a multistep process. Finally, we present a new combined (coupled plus random hydrolysis) multiple-protofilament model that is a simple, analytically solvable generalization of a single-protofilament model. This model accounts for the observed lifetimes of growing microtubules, the delay to catastrophe following dilution and describes catastrophe as a multistep process. {\textcopyright} 2013 WILEY Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Microtubules are polarized polymers that exhibit dynamic instability, with alternating phases of elongation and shortening, particularly at the more dynamic plus-end. Microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) localize to and track with growing microtubule plus-ends in the cell. +TIPs regulate microtubule dynamics and mediate interactions with other cellular components. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the +TIP tracking activity are not well understood, however. We reconstituted the +TIP tracking of mammalian proteins EB1 and CLIP-170 in vitro at single-molecule resolution using time-lapse total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. We found that EB1 is capable of dynamically tracking growing microtubule plus-ends. Our single-molecule studies demonstrate that EB1 exchanges rapidly at microtubule plus-ends with a dwell time of {\textless}1 s, indicating that single EB1 molecules go through multiple rounds of binding and dissociation during microtubule polymerization. CLIP-170 exhibits lattice diffusion and fails to selectively track microtubule ends in the absence of EB1; the addition of EB1 is both necessary and sufficient to mediate plus-end tracking by CLIP-170. Single-molecule analysis of the CLIP-170-EB1 complex also indicates a short dwell time at growing plus-ends, an observation inconsistent with the copolymerization of this complex with tubulin for plus-end-specific localization. GTP hydrolysis is required for +TIP tracking, because end-specificity is lost when tubulin is polymerized in the presence of guanosine 5′-[$\alpha$,$\beta$-methylene]triphosphate (GMPCPP). Together, our data provide insight into the mechanisms driving plus-end tracking by mammalian +TIPs and suggest that EB1 specifically recognizes the distinct lattice structure at the growing microtubule end. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fibrillar collagens are well known for their links to human diseases, with which all have been associated except for the two most recently identified fibrillar collagens, type XXIV collagen and type XXVII collagen. To assess functions and potential disease phenotypes of type XXVII collagen, we examined its roles in zebrafish embryonic and post-embryonic development. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified two type XXVII collagen genes in zebrafish, col27a1a and col27a1b. Both col27a1a and col27a1b were expressed in notochord and cartilage in the embryo and early larva. To determine sites of type XXVII collagen function, col27a1a and col27a1b were knocked down using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides. Knockdown of col27a1a singly or in conjunction with col27a1b resulted in curvature of the notochord at early stages and formation of scoliotic curves as well as dysmorphic vertebrae at later stages. These defects were accompanied by abnormal distributions of cells and protein localization in the notochord, as visualized by transmission electron microscopy, as well as delayed vertebral mineralization as detected histologically. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, our findings indicate a key role for type XXVII collagen in notochord morphogenesis and axial skeletogenesis and suggest a possible human disease phenotype.},

abstract = {Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) and infantile systemic hyalinosis (ISH) are autosomal recessive conditions characterized by multiple subcutaneous skin nodules, gingival hypertrophy, joint contractures, and hyaline deposition. We previously mapped the gene for JHF to chromosome 4q21. We now report the identification of 15 different mutations in the gene encoding capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2) in 17 families with JHF or ISH. CMG2 is a transmembrane protein that is induced during capillary morphogenesis and that binds laminin and collagen IV via a von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain. Of interest, CMG2 also functions as a cellular receptor for anthrax toxin. Preliminary genotype-phenotype analyses suggest that abrogation of binding by the vWA domain results in severe disease typical of ISH, whereas in-frame mutations affecting a novel, highly conserved cytoplasmic domain result in a milder phenotype. These data (1) demonstrate that JHF and ISH are allelic conditions and (2) implicate perturbation of basement-membrane matrix assembly as the cause of the characteristic perivascular hyaline deposition seen in these conditions.},

abstract = {The Schizosaccharomyces pombe CLIP170-associated protein (CLASP) Peg1 was identified in a screen for mutants with spindle formation defects and a screen for molecules that antagonized EB1 function. The conditional peg1.1 mutant enabled us to identify key features of Peg1 function. First, Peg1 was required to form a spindle and astral microtubules, yet destabilized interphase microtubules. Second, Peg1 was required to slow the polymerization rate of interphase microtubules that establish end-on contact with the cortex at cell tips. Third, Peg1 antagonized the action of S. pombe CLIP170 (Tip1) and EB1 (Mal3). Fourth, although Peg1 resembled higher eukaryotic CLASPs by physically associating with both Mal3 and Tip1, neither Tip1 nor Mal3 was required for Peg1 to destabilize interphase microtubules or for it to associate with microtubules. Conversely, neither Mal3 nor Tip1 required Peg1 to associate with microtubules or cell tips. Consistently, while mal3.$\Delta$ and tip1.$\Delta$ disrupted linear growth, corrupting peg1+did not. Fifth, peg1.1 phenotypes resembled those arising from deletion of the single heavy or both light chains of fission yeast dynein. Furthermore, all interphase phenotypes arising from peg1+manipulation relied on dynein function. Thus, the impact of S. pombe CLASP on interphase microtubule behavior is more closely aligned to dynein than EB1 or CLIP170. {\textcopyright} 2006 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Merotelic kinetochore orientation is a misattachment in which a single kinetochore binds microtubules from both spindle poles rather than just one and can produce anaphase lagging chromosomes, a major source of aneuploidy [1]. Merotelic kinetochore orientation occurs frequently in early mitosis, does not block chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate, and is not detected by the spindle checkpoint [2-5]. However, microtubules to the incorrect pole are usually significantly reduced or eliminated before anaphase [3, 6]. We discovered that the frequency of lagging chromosomes in anaphase is very sensitive to partial inhibition of Aurora kinase activity by ZM447439 at a dose, 3 $\mu$M, that has little effect on histone phosphorylation, metaphase chromosome alignment, and cytokinesis in PtK1 cells. Partial Aurora kinase inhibition increased the frequency of merotelic kinetochores in late metaphase, and the fraction of microtubules to the incorrect pole. Measurements of fluorescence dissipation after photoactivation showed that kinetochore-microtubule turnover in prometaphase is substantially suppressed by partial Aurora kinase inhibition. Our results support a preanaphase correction mechanism for merotelic attachments in which correct plus-end attachments are pulled away from high concentrations of Aurora B at the inner centromere, and incorrect merotelic attachments are destabilized by being pulled toward the inner centromere. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We also present a model of the mechanism underlying S. cerevisiae transformation, based on recent reports and the mechanism of transfection in mammalian systems. This model predicts that DNA attaches to the cell wall and enters the cell via endocytotic membrane invagination, although how DNA reaches the nucleus is unknown. Polyethylene glycol is indispensable for successful transformation of intact cells and the attachment of DNA and also possibly acts on the membrane to increase the transformation efficiency. Both lithium acetate and heat shock, which enhance the transformation efficiency of intact cells but not that of spheroplasts, probably help DNA to pass through the cell wall. {\textcopyright} 2010 Landes Bioscience},

abstract = {Kinetochores are macromolecular machines that couple chromosomes to dynamic microtubule tips during cell division, thereby generating force to segregate the chromosomes. Accurate segregation depends on selective stabilization of correct ‘bi-oriented' kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which come under tension due to opposing forces exerted by microtubules. Tension is thought to stabilize these bi-oriented attachments indirectly, by suppressing the destabilizing activity of a kinase, Aurora B. However, a complete mechanistic understanding of the role of tension requires reconstitution of kinetochore-microtubule attachments for biochemical and biophysical analyses in vitro. Here we show that native kinetochore particles retaining the majority of kinetochore proteins can be purified from budding yeast and used to reconstitute dynamic microtubule attachments. Individual kinetochore particles maintain load-bearing associations with assembling and disassembling ends of single microtubules for {\textgreater}30 min, providing a close match to the persistent coupling seen in vivo between budding yeast kinetochores and single microtubules. Moreover, tension increases the lifetimes of the reconstituted attachments directly, via a catch bond-like mechanism that does not require Aurora B. Based on these findings, we propose that tension selectively stabilizes proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments in vivo through a combination of direct mechanical stabilization and tension-dependent phosphoregulation.},

abstract = {We analyzed the distribution of actin filament lengths by optical microscopy (OM). OM avoids possible alterations in the size or structure of actin filaments occurring during sample preparation for electron microscopy (EM). Images of F-actin labeled with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-phalloidin were analyzed for both size distribution and flexibility. In the standard buffer [25 mM potassium acetate, 4 mM MgSO4, 25 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane acetate, pH 7.5, 20 mM beta-mercaptoethanol] filaments did not aggregate into bundles and remained stable at nanomolar concentrations for at least 1 h. At the same concentration, actin labeled directly with rhodamine (no phalloidin) formed unstable filaments whose average length decreased with time. The number average length of TRITC-phalloidin labeled filaments (Ln) was 4.90 microns, the ratio (rho) of the weight average length to the number average length was 2.06, and the correlation length (1/lambda) was 8.33 microns. These parameters were in good agreement with the values determined by EM for filaments shorter than 8 microns. Passing G-actin through a Sephadex G-150 column before polymerization did not have a significant effect on the distribution of lengths but made filaments more stiff (1/lambda = 12.5 microns). Millimolar concentration of ATP increased the correlation length, and gelsolin had the expected fragmenting effect on filaments. These results show that OM can be used as a fast and reliable method to analyze the distribution and flexibility of actin filaments and suggest that, in spite of extensive manipulation of actin filaments during sample preparation, EM is a valid tool for determination of size parameters of actin filaments.},

The way platelets respond during a clotting process is known to depend on their size, with important physiological consequences. We characterized the cytoskeleton of platelets as a function of their size. In resting Human and Mice platelets, we find a quadradic law between the size of a platelet and the amount of microtubule polymer it contains. We further estimate the length and number of microtubules in the marginal band using Electron and Super-resolution microscopy. In platelets activated with ADP, the marginal band coils as a consequence of cortical contraction driven by actin. We observe that this elastic coiling response is accompanied by a reversible shortening of the marginal band. Moreover, larger platelets have a higher propensity to coil. These results establish the dynamic equilibrium that is responsible for platelet size and differential response on a more quantitative level.},

abstract = {Kinesin-8 motor proteins destabilize microtubules. Their absence during cell division is associated with disorganized mitotic chromosome movements and chromosome loss. Despite recent work studying effects of kinesin-8s on microtubule dynamics, it remains unclear whether the kinesin-8 mitotic phenotypes are consequences of their effect on microtubule dynamics, their well-established motor activity, or additional, unknown functions. To better understand the role of kinesin-8 proteins in mitosis, we studied the effects of deletion of the fission yeast kinesin-8 proteins Klp5 and Klp6 on chromosome movements and spindle length dynamics. Aberrant microtubule-driven kinetochore pushing movements and tripolar mitotic spindles occurred in cells lacking Klp5 but not Klp6. Kinesin-8-deletion strains showed large fluctuations in metaphase spindle length, suggesting a disruption of spindle length stabilization. Comparison of our results from light microscopy with a mathematical model suggests that kinesin-8-induced effects on microtubule dynamics, kinetochore attachment stability, and sliding force in the spindle can explain the aberrant chromosome movements and spindle length fluctuations seen.},

* They say that decrease in kinesin-8 causes less force. They say that some reports say kip3D causes higher force/higher stretching of kinetochores, but at least in Tytell and Sorger 2006 West 2002, this would be detachment of kinetochores discussed in Mary2015. They also find this in this study

* KLP5 ALONE CAN FORM homodimer, not klp6

They use cold treatment that depol. microtubules and makes chromosomes float

In wild type first the microtubule is dragged towards the pole and then cetnered, in deletions of kinesin8, they see even pushing away from the pole.

The time it takes to capture changes, k5+k6D is actually faster, likely because mts are longer and cover more space in exploration, but k5Dk6+ or k5Dk6D are slower, this might be just this pushing away that is not observed ink 5+k6D, the capture itself might also be quick in k5Dk6+ or k5Dk6D but then they are pushed away.

Antiparallel microtubule overlaps in the spindle center are essential for establishing bipolarity and maintaining spindle stability throughout mitosis. In anaphase, this antiparallel microtubule array is tightly bundled forming the midzone, which serves as a hub for the recruitment of proteins essential for late mitotic events. The molecular mechanism of midzone formation and the control of its size are not understood. Using an in vitro reconstitution approach, we show here that PRC1 autonomously bundles antiparallel microtubules and recruits Xklp1, a kinesin-4, selectively to overlapping antiparallel microtubules. The processive motor Xklp1 controls overlap size by overlap length-dependent microtubule growth inhibition. Our results mechanistically explain how the two conserved, essential midzone proteins PRC1 and Xklp1 cooperate to constitute a minimal protein module capable of dynamically organizing the core structure of the central anaphase spindle. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Kinesin-12 motors are a little studied branch of the kinesin superfamily with the human protein (Kif15) implicated in spindle mechanics and chromosome movement. In this study, we reconstitute full-length hKif15 and its microtubule-targeting factor hTpx2 in vitro to gain insight into the motors mode of operation. We reveal that hKif15 is a plus-end-directed processive homotetramer that can step against loads of up to 3.5 pN. We further show that hKif15 is the first kinesin that effectively switches microtubule tracks at intersections, enabling it to navigate microtubule networks, such as the spindle. hKif15 tetramers are also capable of cross-linking microtubules, but unexpectedly, this does not depend on hTpx2. Instead, we find that hTpx2 inhibits hKif15 stepping when microtubule-bound. Our data reveal that hKif15 is a second tetrameric spindle motor in addition to the kinesin-5 Eg5 and provides insight into the mechanisms by which hKif15 and its inhibitor hTpx2 modulate spindle microtubule architecture.Before a cell can divide, it produces an extra copy of all its chromosomes, and it must then ensure that each daughter cell ends up with one copy of each chromosome. During the division process, a structure called the spindle forms in the cell. This spindle is made of thread-like extensions called microtubules that grow from two poles at opposite ends of the cell. These microtubules are responsible for getting the chromosomes to line up in the middle of the cell, and then pulling half of the chromosomes to one end of the cell, and half to the other end. The cell then divides into two daughter cells.Two motor proteins—so-called because they consume chemical energy to ‘walk' along the microtubules—have important roles in this process: Kif11 motor proteins mainly drive the formation of the spindle and thus division of the chromosomes. A cell that does not contain Kif11 can only divide if it contains extra copies of a second motor protein called Kif15: this suggests that Kif15 can serve as some sort of back up for Kif11.Normal cells only divide when new cells are needed for growth or to replace old cells that have died. Cancer cells, on the other hand, divide in a way that is not controlled. Drugs that interfere with Kif11 have been developed in the hope that they will stop cancer cells dividing, but these drugs have not been very effective in clinical tests, possibly due to the Kif15 back up. Scientists hope, therefore, that a better understanding of the role of Kif15 may lead to improved cancer treatments.Drechsler et al. have isolated individual Kif15 motor proteins and used advanced microscopy techniques to study them in action. These experiments showed that Kif15 motor proteins can travel long distances along a single microtubule, and can also switch to a different microtubule at intersections. This movement of Kif15 is stopped when they bump into Tpx2 proteins, which are sitting on the microtubules. Together, these proteins can also form links between microtubules that can withstand high forces. These properties provide a starting point to understand how Kif15 can act as a back up for Kif11 in cells. In the future, it will be important to work out how Kif11 and Kif15 motor proteins work together in teams to build the spindle.},

In yeast, the ortholog of the Aurora B-INCENP protein kinase complex (Ipl1-Sli15) may have a role in this crucial process, because it is necessary to prevent attachment of sister kinetochores to microtubules from the same spindle pole. We investigated IPL1 function in cells that cannot replicate their chromosomes but nevertheless duplicate their spindle pole bodies (SPBs). Kinetochores detach from old SPBs and reattach to old and new SPBs with equal frequency in IPL1+ cells, but remain attached to old SPBs in ipl1 mutants. This raises the possibility that Ipl1-Sli15 facilitates bi-orientation by promoting turnover of kinetochore-SPB connections until traction of sister kinetochores toward opposite spindle poles creates tension in the surrounding chromatin.},

abstract = {Migration of cells in higher organisms is mediated by adhesion receptors, such as integrins, that link the cell to extracellular-matrix ligands, transmitting forces and signals necessary for locomotion. Whether cells will migrate or not on a given substratum, and also their speed, depends on several variables related to integrin-ligand interactions, including ligand levels, integrin levels, and integrin-ligand binding affinities. These and other factors affect the way molecular systems integrate to effect and regulate cell migration. Here we show that changes in cell migration speed resulting from three separate variables-substratum ligand level, cell integrin expression level, and integrin-ligand binding affinity-are all quantitatively predictable through the changes they cause in a single unifying parameter: short-term cell-substratum adhesion strength. This finding is consistent with predictions of a mathematical model for cell migration. The ligand concentration promoting maximum migration speed decreases reciprocally as integrin expression increases. Increases in integrin-ligand affinity similarly result in maximal migration at reciprocally lower ligand concentrations. The maximum speed attainable, however, remains unchanged as ligand concentration, integrin expression, or integrin-ligand affinity vary, suggesting that integrin coupling with intracellular motors remains unaltered.},

Several of these proteins have important functions during interphase and mitosis in the modulation of the dynamic properties of microtubules, however, the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. To investigate the role of Mast in the regulation of microtubule behaviour during interphase, we used RNAi in Drosophila S2 culture cells stably expressing GFP-$\alpha$-tubulin and followed the behaviour of microtubules in vivo. Mast depleted cells show a significant reduction of microtubule density and an abnormal interphase microtubule array that rarely reaches the cell cortex. Analysis of the dynamic parameters revealed that in the absence of Mast, microtubules are highly dynamic, constantly growing or shrinking. These alterations are characterized by a severe reduction in the transition frequencies to and from the pause state. Moreover, analysis of de novo microtubule polymerization after cold treatment showed that Mast is not required for nucleation since Mast depleted cells nucleate microtubules soon after return to normal temperature. Taken together these results suggest that Mast plays an essential role in reducing the dynamic behaviour of microtubules by specifically promoting the pause state. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

During MT growth, the Tea2/Tip1/Mal3 complex remains bound to the plus ends of iMT bundles, thereby restricting access to the plus ends by Klp5/Klp6/Mcp1, which accumulate behind it. At cell ends, Klp5/Klp6/Mcp1 invades the space occupied by the Tea2/Tip1/Tea1 kinesin complex triggering its displacement from iMT plus ends and MT catastrophe.

The subsequent sorting of short MTs into networks like the mitotic spindle requires molecular motors that laterally slide overlapping MTs and bundling proteins that statically connect MTs. How bundling proteins interfere with MT sliding is unclear. In bipolar MT bundles in fission yeast, we found that the bundler ase1p localized all along the length of antiparallel MTs, whereas the motor klp2p (kinesin-14) accumulated only at MT plus ends. Consequently, sliding forces could only overcome resistant bundling forces for short, newly nucleated MTs, which were transported to their correct position within bundles. Ase1p thus regulated sliding forces based on polarity and overlap length, and computer simulations showed these mechanisms to be sufficient to generate stable bipolar bundles. By combining motor and bundling proteins, cells can thus dynamically organize stable regions of overlap between cytoskeletal filaments.},

A prototypical example of cytoskeletal remodeling is mitotic spindle assembly, during which microtubules nucleate, undergo dynamic instability, bundle, and organize into a bipolar spindle. Key mechanisms of this process include regulated filament polymerization, cross-linking, and motor-protein activity. Remarkably, using passive cross-linkers, fission yeast can assemble a bipolar spindle in the absence of motor proteins. We develop a torque-balance model that describes this reorganization because of dynamic microtubule bundles, spindle-pole bodies, the nuclear envelope, and passive cross-linkers to predict spindle-assembly dynamics. We compare these results to those obtained with kinetic Monte Carlo-Brownian dynamics simulations, which include cross-linker-binding kinetics and other stochastic effects. Our results show that rapid cross-linker reorganization to microtubule overlaps facilitates cross-linker-driven spindle assembly, a testable prediction for future experiments. Combining these two modeling techniques, we illustrate a general method for studying cytoskeletal network reorganization.},

During prometaphase, the KT initially interacts with a single MT extending from a spindle pole and then moves towards a spindle pole. Subsequently, MTs from the other spindle pole also interact with the KT. Eventually, one sister KT becomes attached to MTs from one pole while the other sister to those from the other pole (sister KT bi-orientation). If sister KTs interact with MTs with aberrant orientation, this must be corrected to attain proper bi-orientation (error correction) before the anaphase is initiated. Here, I discuss how KTs initially interact with MTs and how this interaction develops into bi-orientation; both processes are fundamentally crucial for proper chromosome segregation in the subsequent anaphase.},

abstract = {Proper chromosome segregation is of paramount importance for proper genetic inheritance. Defects in chromosome segregation can lead to aneuploidy, which is a hallmark of cancer cells. Eukaryotic chromosome segregation is accomplished by the bipolar spindle. Additional mechanisms, such as the spindle assembly checkpoint and centromere positioning, further help to ensure complete segregation fidelity. Here we present the fission yeast csi2+. csi2p localizes to the spindle poles, where it regulates mitotic microtubule dynamics, bipolar spindle formation, and subsequent chromosome segregation. csi2 deletion (csi2$\Delta$) results in abnormally long mitotic microtubules, high rate of transient monopolar spindles, and subsequent high rate of chromosome segregation defects. Because csi2$\Delta$ has multiple phenotypes, it enables estimates of the relative contribution of the different mechanisms to the overall chromosome segregation process. Centromere positioning, microtubule dynamics, and bipolar spindle formation can all contribute to chromosome segregation. However, the major determinant of chromosome segregation defects in fission yeast may be microtubule dynamic defects.},

abstract = {Membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is an integral type I transmembrane multidomain zinc-dependent endopeptidase involved in extracellular matrix remodelling in physiological as well as pathological processes. MT1-MMP participates in the regulated turnover of various extracellular matrix components as well as the activation of secreted metalloproteinases and the cleavage of various cell membrane components. MT1-MMP expression has been reported to correlate with the malignancy of various tumour types and is thought to be an important mediator of cell migration and invasion. Recently, it has been proposed that internalisation of the enzyme from the cell surface is a major short-term level of MT1-MMP regulation controlling the net amount of active enzyme present at the plasma membrane. In this paper we show that, in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, MT1-MMP is internalised from the cell surface and colocalises with various markers of the endocytic compartment. Interestingly, we observed that in these cells, internalisation occurs by a combination of both clathrin-mediated and -independent pathways, most probably involving caveolae. In addition, internalised MT1-MMP is recycled to the cell surface, which could, in addition to downregulation of the enzymatic activity, represent a rapid response mechanism used by the cell for relocalising active MT1-MMP at the leading edge during migration.},

CYK-4 is enriched within sperm, and paternally donated CYK-4 is required for polarity. These data suggest that CYK-4 provides a molecular link between fertilization and polarity establishment in the one-cell embryo.

abstract = {An aster of microtubules is a set of flexible polar filaments with dynamic plus ends that irradiate from a common location at which the minus ends of the filaments are found. Processive soluble oligomeric motor complexes can bind simultaneously to two microtubules, and thus exert forces between two asters. Using computer simulations, I have explored systematically the possible steady-state regimes reached by two asters under the action of various kinds of oligomeric motors. As expected, motor complexes can induce the asters to fuse, for example when the complexes consist only of minus end-directed motors, or to fully separate, when the motors are plus end directed. More surprisingly, complexes made of two motors of opposite directionalities can also lead to antiparallel interactions between overlapping microtubules that are stable and sustained, like those seen in mitotic spindle structures. This suggests that such heterocomplexes could have a significant biological role, if they exist in the cell.},

abstract = {Microtubules are dynamic filaments whose ends alternate between periods of slow growth and rapid shortening as they explore intracellular space and move organelles. A key question is how regulatory proteins modulate catastrophe, the conversion from growth to shortening. To study this process, we reconstituted microtubule dynamics in the absence and presence of the kinesin-8 Kip3 and the kinesin-13 MCAK. Surprisingly, we found that, even in the absence of the kinesins, the microtubule catastrophe frequency depends on the age of the microtubule, indicating that catastrophe is a multistep process. Kip3 slowed microtubule growth in a length-dependent manner and increased the rate of aging. In contrast, MCAK eliminated the aging process. Thus, both kinesins are catastrophe factors; Kip3 mediates fine control of microtubule length by narrowing the distribution of maximum lengths prior to catastrophe, whereas MCAK promotes rapid restructuring of the microtubule cytoskeleton by making catastrophe a first-order random process. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In the present study we examined the levels of cell-surface MT1-MMP, MMP-2 activation and cleavage of MT1-MMP substrates in 293T cells transfected with the MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 genes. Co-expression of TIMP-2 at an appropriate level increased the level of cell-surface MT1-MMP, both the TIMP-2-bound and free forms, and generated processed MMP-2 with gelatin-degrading activity. In contrast, MT1-MMP substrates testican-1 and syndecan-1 were cleaved by the cells expressing MT1-MMP, which was inhibited by TIMP-2 even at levels that stimulate MMP-2 activation. These results suggest that TIMP-2 environment determines MT1-MMP substrate choice between direct cleavage of its own substrates and MMP-2 activation.},

The sperm-supplied centrosomes are required to initiate this cortical reorganization. Several questions about this event remain unanswered: how is the acto-myosin network regulated during polarization and how does acto-myosin reorganization lead to asymmetric PAR protein distribution? As we discuss, recent studies show that C. elegans embryos use two GTPases, RHO-1 and CDC-42, to regulate these two steps in polarity establishment. Although RHO-1 and CDC-42 control distinct aspects of polarization, they function interdependently to regulate polarity establishment in C. elegans embryos.},

In a so-called 'open' mitosis the envelope of the mother nucleus is dismantled allowing the cytoplasmic spindle microtubules to capture the chromosomes. Alternatively, cells undergoing 'closed' mitosis assemble the intranuclear spindle and divide the nucleus without ever losing the nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization. Here we focus on the mechanisms underlying mitotic NE dynamics in unicellular eukaryotes undergoing a closed nuclear division, paying specific attention to the emerging roles of the lipid biosynthesis machinery in this process.

abstract = {The three dimensional organization of microtubules in mitotic spindles of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been determined by computer-aided reconstruction from electron micrographs of serially cross-sectioned spindles. Fifteen spindles ranging in length from 0.6-9.4 $\mu$m have been analyzed. Ordered microtubule packing is absent in spindles up to 0.8 $\mu$m, but the total number of microtubules is sufficient to allow one microtubule per kinetochore with a few additional microtubules that may form an interpolar spindle. An obvious bundle of about eight interpolar microtubules was found in spindles 1.3-1.6 $\mu$m long, and we suggest that the {\~{}}32 remaining microtubules act as kinetochore fibers. The relative lengths of the microtubules in these spindles suggest that they may be in an early stage of anaphase, even though these spindles are all situated in the mother cell, not in the isthmus between mother and bud. None of the reconstructed spindles exhibited the uniform populations of kinetochore microtubules characteristic of metaphase. Long spindles (2.7-9.4 $\mu$m), presumably in anaphase B, contained short remnants of a few presumed kinetochore microtubules clustered near the poles and a few long microtubules extending from each pole toward the spindle midplane, where they interdigitated with their counterparts from the other pole. Interpretation of these reconstructed spindles offers some insights into the mechanisms of mitosis in this yeast.},

abstract = {Formin proteins are key regulators of eukaryotic actin filament assembly and elongation, and many species possess multiple formin isoforms. A nomenclature system based on fundamental features would be desirable, to aid the rapid identification and characterization of novel formins. In this article, we attempt to systematize the formin family by performing phylogenetic analyses of the formin homology 2 (FH2) domain, an independently folding region common to all formins, which alone can influence actin dynamics. Through database searches, we identify 101 FH2 domains from 26 eukaryotic species, including 15 in mice. Sequence alignments reveal a highly conserved yeast-specific insert in the "knob loop" region of the FH2 domain, with unknown functional consequences. Phylogenetic analysis using minimum evolution (ME), maximum parsimony (MP), and maximum likelihood (ML) algorithms strongly supports the existence of seven metazoan groups. Yeast FH2 domains segregate from all other eukaryotes, including metazoans, other fungi, plants, and protists. Sequence comparisons of non-FH2 regions support relationships between three metazoan groups (Dia, DAAM, and FRL) and examine previously identified coiled-coil and Diaphanous auto-regulatory domain sequences. This analysis allows for a formin nomenclature system based on sequence relationships, as well as suggesting strategies for the determination of biochemical and cellular activities of these proteins.},

abstract = {Background: It is unknown how oscillations in Cdk1 activity drive the dramatic changes in chromosome and spindle dynamics that occur at the metaphase/anaphase transition. Results: We show that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe monopolin complex has distinct functions in metaphase and anaphase that are determined by the phosphorylation state of its Mde4 subunit. When Cdk1 activity is high in metaphase, Mde4 is hyperphosphorylated on Cdk1 phosphorylation sites and localizes to kinetochores. A nonphosphorylatable mutant of Mde4 does not localize to kinetochores, appears prematurely on the metaphase spindle, and interferes with spindle dynamics and chromosome segregation, illustrating the importance of Cdk1 phosphorylation in regulating metaphase monopolin activity. When Cdk1 activity drops in anaphase, dephosphorylation of Mde4 triggers monopolin localization to the mitotic spindle, where it promotes spindle elongation and integrity, coupling the late mitotic loss of Cdk1 activity to anaphase spindle dynamics. Conclusions: Together, these findings illustrate how the sequential phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of monopolin helps ensure the orderly execution of discrete steps in mitosis. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A boy presented at age 3.5 months with joint contractures, restlessness, and pain on handling. His skin was thickened and there were livid-red macular lesions over bony prominences. Infantile systemic hyalinosis (ISH) was diagnosed, a presumably autosomal recessive, progressive, and painful disorder of as yet unknown pathogenesis. Observation over three years confirmed the diagnosis as typical changes, such as nodules on both ears, pearly papules in the perinasal folds and on the neck, fleshy nodules in the perianal region, and gingival hypertrophy, developed. Skin lesions and painful joint contractures progressed in spite of intense physiotherapy, and at age 3, the child had marked motor disability. The central nervous system (CNS) appeared to be intact and the infant showed normal mental development. Radiologic findings included marked generalized osteopenia, osteolytic erosions in the metaphyses of the long bones, and cortical thinning. Electron microscopy of two skin biopsies demonstrated deposition of floccular amorphous substance that was abundant around, and appeared to originate from, small blood vessels in the dermis, partially interfering with collagen fiber formation. Lysosomal inclusions were not seen. Serum acid hyaluronidase activity was within the normal range, and the synthesis of hyaluronic acid and proteoglycans in cultured skin fibroblasts was similar to that of control cells. A younger sister presented at age two months with painful joint contractures and discrete livid-red macules over both malleoli, and showed a similar progression of the disorder over the first year of life. The diagnosis of ISH should be considered in infants and children presenting with painful joint contractures and skin lesions. The pathogenesis of this disabling and disfiguring disorder remains unclear. Our data confirm probable autosomal recessive inheritance, and do not support lysosomal storage, hyaluronidase deficiency, or a primary collagen disorder, but indicate that the amorphous material accumulating in the skin and articular soft tissues may originate from the blood circulation.},

In epithelia, the relative importance of these two factors is challenging to assess. To do this, we used suspended monolayers devoid of ECM, where divisions become oriented following a stretch, allowing the regulation and function of epithelial division orientation in stress relaxation to be characterized. Using this system, we found that divisions align better with the long, interphase cell axis than with the monolayer stress axis. Nevertheless, because the application of stretch induces a global realignment of interphase long axes along the direction of extension, this is sufficient to bias the orientation of divisions in the direction of stretch. Each division redistributes the mother cell mass along the axis of division. Thus, the global bias in division orientation enables cells to act collectively to redistribute mass along the axis of stretch, helping to return the monolayer to its resting state. Further, this behavior could be quantitatively reproduced using a model designed to assess the impact of autonomous changes in mitotic cell mechanics within a stretched monolayer. In summary, the propensity of cells to divide along their long axis preserves epithelial homeostasis by facilitating both stress relaxation and isotropic growth without the need for cells to read or transduce mechanical signals.},

abstract = {During cell division metaphase spindles maintain constant length, whereas spindle microtubules continuously flux polewards, requiring addition of tubulin subunits at microtubule plus-ends, polewards translocation of the microtubule lattice, and removal of tubulin subunits from microtubule minus-ends near spindle poles. How these processes are coordinated is unknown. Here, we show that dynein/dynactin, a multi-subunit microtubule minus-end-directed motor complex, and NuMA, a microtubule cross-linker, regulate spindle length. Fluorescent speckle microscopy reveals that dynactin or NuMA inhibition suppresses microtubule disassembly at spindle poles without affecting polewards microtubule sliding. The observed uncoupling of these two components of flux indicates that microtubule depolymerization is not required for the microtubule transport associated with polewards flux. Inhibition of Kif2a, a KinI kinesin known to depolymerize microtubules in vitro, results in increased spindle microtubule length. We find that dynein/dynactin contribute to the targeting of Kif2a to spindle poles, suggesting a model in which dynein/dynactin regulate spindle length and coordinate flux by maintaining microtubule depolymerizing activities at spindle poles.},

Mitotic spindle size correlates with cell size, but the mechanisms for this scaling remain unclear. Using live cell imaging, we analyzed spindle scaling during embryo cleavage in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. We reveal a common scaling mechanism, where the growth rate of spindle microtubules scales with cell volume, which explains spindle shortening. Spindle assembly timing is, however, constant throughout successive divisions. Analyses in silico suggest that controlling the microtubule growth rate is sufficient to scale spindle length and maintain a constant assembly timing. We tested our in silico predictions to demonstrate that modulating cell volume or microtubule growth rate in vivo induces a proportional spindle size change. Our results suggest that scalability of the microtubule growth rate when cell size varies adapts spindle length to cell volume. During early embryonic development, the mitotic spindle scales with decreasing cell size across successive reductive divisions. Lacroix et al. uncover, using in vivo and in silico analyses, a common scaling mechanism whereby spindle microtubule growth rate is coupled to cell volume for size scaling while maintaining constant spindle assembly timing.},

abstract = {Background: Microtubules in interphase Schizosaccharomyces pombe are essential for maintaining the linear growth habit of these cells. The dynamics of assembly and disassembly of these microtubules are so far uncharacterised. Results: Live cell confocal imaging of $\alpha$1 tubulin tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein revealed longitudinally oriented, dynamically unstable interphase microtubule assemblies (IMAs). The IMAs were uniformly bright along their length apart from a zone of approximately doubly intense fluorescence commonly present close to their centres. The ends of each IMA switched from growth ({\~{}}3.0 $\mu$m/min) to shrinkage ({\~{}}4.5 $\mu$m/min) at 1.0 events per minute and from shrinkage to growth at 1.9 events per minute, and the two ends were equivalently dynamic, suggesting equivalent structure. We accordingly propose a symmetrical model for microtubule packing within the IMAs, in which microtubules are plus ends out and overlap close to the equator of the cell. IMAs may contain multiple copies of this motif; if so, then within each IMA end, the microtubule ends must synchronise catastrophe and rescue. When both ends of an IMA lodge in the hemispherical cell ends, the IMAs start to bend under compression and their overall growth rate is inhibited about twofold. Similar microtubule dynamics were observed in cells ranging in size from half to twice normal length. Patterned photobleaching indicated no detectable treadmilling or microtubule sliding during interphase. Conclusions: The consequence of the mechanisms described is continuous recruitment of microtubule ends to the ends of growing cells, supporting microtubule-based transport into the cell ends and qualitatively accounting for the essential role for microtubules in directing linear cell growth in S. pombe.},

abstract = {Microtubule organization is key to eukaryotic cell structure and function. In most animal cells, interphase microtubules organize around the centrosome, the major microtubule organizing centre (MTOC). Interphase microtubules can also become organized independently of a centrosome, but how acentrosomal microtubules arrays form and whether they are functionally equivalent to centrosomal arrays remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the interphase microtubule arrays of fission yeast cells can persist independently of nuclear-associated MTOCs, including the spindle pole body (SPB)--the centrosomal equivalent. By artificially enucleating cells, we show that arrays can form de novo (self-organize) without nuclear-associated MTOCs, but require the microtubule nucleator mod20-mbo1-mto1 (refs 3-5), the bundling factor ase1 (refs 6,7), and the kinesin klp2 (refs 8,9). Microtubule arrays in enucleated and nucleated cells are morphologically indistinguishable and similarly locate to the cellular axis and centre. By simultaneously tracking nuclear-independent and SPB-associated microtubule arrays within individual nucleated cells, we show that both define the cell centre with comparable precision. We propose that in fission yeast, nuclear-independent, self-organized, acentrosomal microtubule arrays are structurally and functionally equivalent to centrosomal arrays.},

The stereotypical orientation of cell divisions has been proposed to be a fundamental mechanism by which proliferating and growing tissues take shape. However, the actual contribution of stereotypical division orientation (SDO) to tissue morphogenesis is unclear. In zebrafish, cell divisions with stereotypical orientation have been implicated in both body-axis elongation and neural rod formation, although there is little direct evidence for a critical function of SDO in either of these processes. Here we show that SDO is required for formation of the neural rod midline during neurulation but dispensable for elongation of the body axis during gastrulation. Our data indicate that SDO during both gastrulation and neurulation is dependent on the noncanonical Wnt receptor Frizzled 7 (Fz7) and that interfering with cell division orientation leads to severe defects in neural rod midline formation but not body-axis elongation. These findings suggest a novel function for Fz7-controlled cell division orientation in neural rod midline formation during neurulation.},

In order to establish whether this material acts not only to nucleate the microtubules which form the axonemes but also to give the axoneme its characteristic pattern, the microtubules were disassembled with low temperature and stages in their reformation were studied. It was shown that even though the microtubules appear to be nucleated from the centroplast, pattern formation first appeared at a distance from the centroplast. Thus, the axonemal pattern could not be attributed to any prepattern in the centroplast. Rather, the pattern appears to arise by specific interactions between tubules brought about by bridges. It was concluded that each tubule could bind to a maximum of four other tubules and that once one bridge attached to a tubule it specified the binding positions of the others, thus giving the characteristic axonemal pattern of Raphidiophrys.},

abstract = {Background: The pole-to-pole distance of the metaphase spindle is reasonably constant in a given cell type; in the case of vertebrate female oocytes, this steady-state length can be maintained for substantial lengths of time, during which time microtubules remain highly dynamic. Although a number of molecular perturbations have been shown to influence spindle length, a global understanding of the factors that determine metaphase spindle length has not been achieved. Results: Using the Drosophila S2 cell line, we depleted or overexpressed proteins that either generate sliding forces between spindle microtubules (Kinesin-5, Kinesin-14, dynein), promote microtubule polymerization (EB1, Mast/Orbit [CLASP], Minispindles [Dis1/XMAP215/TOG]) or depolymerization (Kinesin-8, Kinesin-13), or mediate sister-chromatid cohesion (Rad21) in order to explore how these forces influence spindle length. Using high-throughput automated microscopy and semiautomated image analyses of {\textgreater}4000 spindles, we found a reduction in spindle size after RNAi of microtubule-polymerizing factors or overexpression of Kinesin-8, whereas longer spindles resulted from the knockdown of Rad21, Kinesin-8, or Kinesin-13. In contrast, and differing from previous reports, bipolar spindle length is relatively insensitive to increases in motor-generated sliding forces. However, an ultrasensitive monopolar-to-bipolar transition in spindle architecture was observed at a critical concentration of the Kinesin-5 sliding motor. These observations could be explained by a quantitative model that proposes a coupling between microtubule depolymerization rates and microtubule sliding forces. Conclusions: By integrating extensive RNAi with high-throughput image-processing methodology and mathematical modeling, we reach to a conclusion that metaphase spindle length is sensitive to alterations in microtubule dynamics and sister-chromatid cohesion, but robust against alterations of microtubule sliding force. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mitotic chromosome motions are driven by microtubules (MTs) and associated proteins that couple kinetochores to MT ends. A good coupler should ensure a high stability of attachment, even when the chromosome changes direction or experiences a large opposing force. The optimal coupler is also expected to be efficient in converting the energy of MT depolymerization into chromosome motility. As was shown years ago, a "sleeve"-based, chromosome-associated structure could, in principle, couple MT dynamics to chromosome motion. A recently identified kinetochore complex from yeast, the "Dam1" or "DASH" complex, may function as an encircling coupler in vivo. Some features of the Dam1 ring differ from those of the "sleeve," but whether these differences are significant has not been examined. Here, we analyze theoretically the biomechanical properties of encircling couplers that have properties of the Dam1/DASH complex, such as its large diameter and inward-directed extensions. We demonstrate that, if the coupler is modeled as a wide ring with links that bind the MT wall, its optimal performance is achieved when the linkers are flexible and their binding to tubulin dimers is strong. The diffusive movement of such a coupler is limited, but MT depolymerization can drive its motion via a "forced walk," whose features differ significantly from those of the mechanisms based on biased diffusion. Our analysis identifies key experimental parameters whose values should determine whether the Dam1/DASH ring moves via diffusion or a forced walk. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Using a computerized fluorescence microscope system to observe fluorescently stained cellular structures in vivo, we have examined the dynamics of chromosomes and microtubules during the process of meiosis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Fission yeast meiotic prophase is characterized by a distinctive type of nuclear movement that is led by telomeres clustered at the spindle-pole body (the centrosome-equivalent structure in fungi): the nucleus oscillates back and forth along the cell axis, moving continuously between the two ends of the cell for some hours prior to the meiotic divisions. To obtain a dynamic view of this oscillatory nuclear movement in meiotic prophase, we visualized microtubules and chromosomes in living cells using jellyfish green fluorescent protein fused with alpha-tubulin and a DNA-specific fluorescent dye, Hoechst 33342, respectively. Continuous observation of chromosomes and microtubules in these cells demonstrated that the oscillatory nuclear movement is mediated by dynamic reorganization of astral microtubules originating from the spindle-pole body. During each half-oscillatory period, the microtubules extending rearward from the leading edge of the nucleus elongate to drive the nucleus to one end of the cell. When the nucleus reversed direction, its motion during the second half of the oscillation was not driven by the same microtubules that drove its motion during the first half, but rather by newly assembled microtubules. Reversible inhibition of nuclear movement by an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization, thiabendazole, confirmed the involvement of astral microtubules in oscillatory nuclear movement. The speed of the movement fluctuated within a range 0 to 15 micron/minute, with an average of about 5 microm/minute. We propose a model in which the oscillatory nuclear movement is mediated by dynamic instability and selective stabilization of astral microtubules.},

abstract = {We have developed video microscopy methods to visualize the assembly and disassembly of individual microtubules at 33-ms intervals. Porcine brain tubulin, free of microtubule-associated proteins, was assembled onto axoneme fragments at 37 degrees C, and the dynamic behavior of the plus and minus ends of microtubules was analyzed for tubulin concentrations between 7 and 15.5 microM. Elongation and rapid shortening were distinctly different phases. At each end, the elongation phase was characterized by a second order association and a substantial first order dissociation reaction. Association rate constants were 8.9 and 4.3 microM-1 s-1 for the plus and minus ends, respectively; and the corresponding dissociation rate constants were 44 and 23 s-1. For both ends, the rate of tubulin dissociation equaled the rate of tubulin association at 5 microM. The rate of rapid shortening was similar at the two ends (plus = 733 s-1; minus = 915 s-1), and did not vary with tubulin concentration. Transitions between phases were abrupt and stochastic. As the tubulin concentration was increased, catastrophe frequency decreased at both ends, and rescue frequency increased dramatically at the minus end. This resulted in fewer rapid shortening phases at higher tubulin concentrations for both ends and shorter rapid shortening phases at the minus end. At each concentration, the frequency of catastrophe was slightly greater at the plus end, and the frequency of rescue was greater at the minus end. Our data demonstrate that microtubules assembled from pure tubulin undergo dynamic instability over a twofold range of tubulin concentrations, and that the dynamic instability of the plus and minus ends of microtubules can be significantly different. Our analysis indicates that this difference could produce treadmilling, and establishes general limits on the effectiveness of length redistribution as a measure of dynamic instability. Our results are consistent with the existence of a GTP cap during elongation, but are not consistent with existing GTP cap models.},

We show that polymerase activity does not require different kinds of TOGs, nor are there strict requirements for how the TOGs are linked. We identify an unexpected antagonism between the tubulin-binding TOGs and the lattice-binding basic region: lattice binding by the basic region is weak when at least two TOGs engage tubulins, strong when TOGs are empty. End-localization of Stu2 requires unpolymerized tubulin, at least two TOGs, and polymerase competence.

abstract = {The midpoint of the mitotic apparatus is fixed in the future division plane long before the division mechanism develops, and this static relationship has been considered essential in speculations concerning division mechanism establishment. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether prevention of the static relationship affects the establishment process. Sand dollar eggs were reshaped into cylinders by confinement in an elastic capillary tube and, beginning about 20 min before cleavage, the mitotic apparatus was kept in reciprocal motion by alternately compressing the poles. When the movement was continuous and the excursions were 25, 50 or 75 microm, furrow activity developed near the midpoint of the region underlain by the mitotic apparatus. The acuteness of the furrow decreased as the distance the mitotic apparatus was moved increased. When the movement was made discontinuous by allowing the mitotic apparatus to pause at the end of each excursion, the results depended upon the duration of the pause. Pauses 30 s long resulted in a single furrow formed in the midpoint of the entire region underlain by the mitotic apparatus. When the pauses were 45 s long, furrowing activity developed in both regions where the mitotic apparatus was allowed to pause. The results indicated that the normal static relation between the mitotic apparatus midpoint and the division plane is unnecessary for division mechanism establishment. They also demonstrate that a restricted region of contractile activity can be established in the cortex despite experimentally induced spreading and dilution of mitotic apparatus effect.},

abstract = {Cytoskeletal remodeling is essential to eukaryotic cell division and morphogenesis. The mechanical forces driving the restructuring are attributed to the action of molecular motors and the dynamics of cytoskeletal filaments, which both consume chemical energy. By contrast, non-enzymatic filament crosslinkers are regarded as mere friction-generating entities. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that diffusible microtubule crosslinkers of the Ase1/PRC1/Map65 family generate directed microtubule sliding when confined between partially overlapping microtubules. The Ase1-generated forces, directly measured by optical tweezers to be in the piconewton-range, were sufficient to antagonize motor-protein driven microtubule sliding. Force generation is quantitatively explained by the entropic expansion of confined Ase1 molecules diffusing within the microtubule overlaps. The thermal motion of crosslinkers is thus harnessed to generate mechanical work analogous to compressed gas propelling a piston in a cylinder. As confinement of diffusible proteins is ubiquitous in cells, the associated entropic forces are likely of importance for cellular mechanics beyond cytoskeletal networks.},

abstract = {Microtubules are cytoskeletal polymers whose function depends on their property to switch between states of growth and shrinkage. Growing microtubules are thought to be stabilized by a GTP cap at their ends. The nature of this cap, however, is still poorly understood. End Binding proteins (EBs) recruit a diverse range of regulators of microtubule function to growing microtubule ends. Whether the EB binding region is identical to the GTP cap is unclear. Using mutated human tubulin with blocked GTP hydrolysis, we demonstrate that EBs bind with high affinity to the GTP conformation of microtubules. Slowing-down GTP hydrolysis leads to extended GTP caps. We find that cap length determines microtubule stability and that the microtubule conformation changes gradually in the cap as GTP is hydrolyzed. These results demonstrate the critical importance of the kinetics of GTP hydrolysis for microtubule stability and establish that the GTP cap coincides with the EB-binding region.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, the nuclear envelope partitions the nucleus from the cytoplasm. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe undergoes closed mitosis in which the nuclear envelope persists rather than being broken down, as in higher eukaryotic cells [1]. It is therefore assumed that nucleocytoplasmic transport continues during the cell cycle [2]. Here we show that nuclear transport is, in fact, abolished specifically during anaphase of the second meiotic nuclear division. During that time, both nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic proteins disperse throughout the cell, reminiscent of the open mitosis of higher eukaryotes, but the architecture of the S. pombe nuclear envelope itself persists. This functional alteration of the nucleocytoplasmic barrier is likely induced by spore wall formation, because ectopic induction of sporulation signaling leads to premature dispersion of nucleoplasmic proteins. A photobleaching assay demonstrated that nuclear envelope permeability increases abruptly at the onset of anaphase of the second meiotic division. The permeability was not altered when sporulation was inhibited by blocking the trafficking of forespore-membrane vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. The evidence indicates that yeast gametogenesis produces vesicle transport-mediated forespore membranes by inducing nuclear envelope permeabilization. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this technique, one end of a microtubule is attached to the tip of a flexible glass fiber of calibrated stiffness. The other end of the microtubule makes contact with a surface sparsely coated with kinesin. By imaging the tip of the glass fiber on a photodiode detector, displacement of the microtubule by kinesin through as little as 1 nm can be detected and forces as small as 1 pN resolved. Using this force-fiber apparatus we have characterized the mechanical output of this molecular motor. The speed at which a molecule of kinesin moved along the surface of a microtubule decreased linearly as the elastic force was increased. The force required to stop a single kinesin molecule was 5.4 +/- 1.0 pN (mean +/- SD; n = 16), independent of the stiffness of the fiber, the damping from the fluid, and whether the ATP concentration was high or low.},

Nine genes were manipulated using these kanMX6 constructs as templates for PCR. The PCR primers included 60 to 80 bp of flanking sequences homologous to target sequences in the genome. Transformants were screened for homologous integration by PCR. In most cases, the efficiency of homologous integration was ≤50{\%}, and the lowest efficiency encountered was 17{\%}.

End-binding protein 1 (EB1) is a plus-end-tracking protein (+TIP) that accumulates at growing microtubule ends and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. EB1 autonomously binds an extended tubulin-GTP/GDP-Pi structure at growing microtubule ends and acts as a molecular scaffold that recruits a large number of regulatory +TIPs through interaction with CAP-Gly or SxIP motifs. While extensive studies have focused on the structure of EB1-interacting site at microtubule ends and its role as a molecular platform, the mechanisms involved in the negative regulation of EB1 have only started to emerge and remain poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent studies showing that EB1 association with MT ends is regulated by post-translational modifications and affected by microtubule-targeting agents. We also present recent findings that structural MAPs, that have no tip-tracking activity, physically interact with EB1 to prevent its accumulation at microtubule plus ends. These observations point out a novel concept of “endogenous EB1 antagonists” and emphasize the importance of finely regulating EB1 function at growing microtubule ends.},

Mammalian CLASPs encompass three TOG-like domains, TOG1, TOG2, and TOG3, none of which bind to free tubulin. TOG2 is essential for catastrophe suppression, whereas TOG3 mildly enhances rescues but cannot suppress catastrophes. These functions are inhibited by the C-terminal domain of CLASP2, while the TOG1 domain can release this auto-inhibition. TOG2 fused to a positively charged microtubule-binding peptide autonomously accumulates at growing but not shrinking ends, suppresses catastrophes, and stimulates rescues. CLASPs suppress catastrophes by stabilizing growing microtubule ends, including incomplete ones, preventing their depolymerization and promoting their recovery into complete tubes. TOG2 domain is the key determinant of these activities.},

abstract = {Optical trapping experiments reveal details of molecular motor dynamics. In noisy data, temporal structure within the power stroke of motors can be analyzed by ensemble averaging, but this obscures infrequent subcategories of events. We have here developed an analysis method that uses Kalman filtering of measurements, model-based estimation of the power strokes produced by the motor head, and automatic event classification to discriminate between different types of motor events. This method was applied to optical trap measurements of power strokes of the Drosophila kinesin-14 ncd in a three-bead geometry. We found the majority of events to be consistent with the previously discovered minus-end directed power stroke of ncd, occurring with ATP binding. Unexpectedly, 30{\%} of apparent power strokes were plus-directed and 6{\%} of binding events did not terminate in a discernible stroke. Ensemble averaging for each event category revealed that plus- and minus-directed strokes have different size and occur at different instants within the ncd-MT attachment sequence. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of cell polarity in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. These are simple rod-shaped cells that form cortical domains at cell tips for cell growth and at the cell middle for cytokinesis. In both cases, microtubule-based systems help to shape the cell by breaking symmetry, providing endogenous spatial cues to position these sites. The plus ends of dynamic microtubules deliver polarity factors to the cell tips, leading to local activation of the GTPase cdc42p and the actin assembly machinery. Microtubule bundles contribute to positioning the division plane through the nucleus and the cytokinesis factor mid1p. Recent advances illustrate how the spatial and temporal regulation of cell polarization integrates many elements, including historical landmarks, positive and negative controls, and competition between pathways.},

abstract = {Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an excellent organism for studying microtubule dynamics owing to the presence of well-defined microtubule arrays that undergo dramatic rearrangements during various stages of the cell cycle. Using sensitive time-lapse video microscopy and kymographic analysis, we have determined the polymerization/depolymerization kinetics of individual microtubules within these arrays throughout the fission yeast cell cycle. Interphase bundles are composed of 4-7 microtubules that act autonomously, demonstrating that individual microtubules are responsible for mediating the functions ascribed to these arrays. The nucleation and growth of cytoplasmic microtubules is inhibited upon cellular transition into mitosis, leading to their gradual disappearance. At the onset of mitosis, microtubules form on the nuclear face of the spindle pole body and exhibit dramatically increased dynamics. The presence of these intra-nuclear astral microtubules (INA) is reminiscent of spindle assembly and the search and chromosome capture mechanism observed in metazoan cells. Consistent with other in vivo studies, we do not observe microtubule flux in the anaphase B spindle. Finally, the depolymerization of individual microtubules alternates between each half-spindle, resulting in spindle collapse during telophase. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that microtubules in these diverse cytoskeletal arrays have autonomous behaviors that are an essential component of any model describing cell-cycle-dependent changes in the behavior and function of microtubule arrays.},

abstract = {We investigated the in vivo localisation of fission yeast cyclin-dependent kinase cdc2p during mitosis and meiosis. Fusion to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) revealed that cdc2-YFP is present in the cytoplasm at all stages of the cell cycle. Nuclear cdc2-YFP fluorescence oscillates with that of cdc13-YFP cyclin. At G1/S, at least one of cdc13p, cig1p or cig2p B-type cyclins is required for the accumulation of cdc2-YFP into the nucleus. Cdc2-YFP and cdc13-YFP are highly enriched on the spindle pole body of cells in late G2 or arrested at S phase. Both accumulate on the spindle pole bodies and the spindle in prophase and metaphase independently of the microtubule-associated protein dis1p. In anaphase, the cdc2p/cdc13p complex leaves the spindle prior to sister chromatid separation, and cdc13-YFP is enriched at the nuclear periphery before fluorescence disappears. If cdc13p cannot be recognized by the anaphase-promoting complex, cdc2-YFP and cdc13-YFP remain associated with the spindle. In mating cells, cdc2-YFP enters the nucleus as soon as the cells undergo fusion. During karyogamy and meiotic prophase, cdc2-YFP is highly enriched on the centromeres. In meiosis I, association of cdc2-YFP with the spindle and the spindle pole bodies shows differences to mitotic cells, suggesting different mechanisms of spindle formation. This study suggests that changes in cdc2p localisation are important for both mitosis and meiosis regulation.},

Endothelial cell proliferation is essential for the subsequent growth and maturation of the blood vessels. However, how cell division, lumen formation and cell rearrangement are coordinated during angiogenic sprouting has so far not been investigated at detailed cellular level. Reasoning that different tubular architectures may impose discrete mechanistic constraints on endothelial cell division, we analyzed and compared the sequential steps of cell division, namely mitotic rounding, cytokinesis, actin re-distribution and adherence junction formation, in different blood vessels. In particular, we characterized the interplay between cell rearrangement, mitosis and lumen dynamics within unicellular and multicellular tubes. The lumen of unicellular tubes becomes constricted and is ultimately displaced from the plane of cell division, where a de novo junction forms through the recruitment of junctional proteins at the site of abscission.

The integrated data set supports quantitative biology and affords unique insights into cell regulation. Although mRNAs are typically expressed in a narrow range above 1 copy/cell, most long, noncoding RNAs, except for a distinct subset, are tightly repressed below 1 copy/cell. Cell-cycle-regulated transcription tunes mRNA numbers to phase-specific requirements but can also bring about more switch-like expression. Proteins greatly exceed mRNAs in abundance and dynamic range, and concentrations are regulated to functional demands. Upon transition to quiescence, the proteome changes substantially, but, in stark contrast to mRNAs, proteins do not uniformly decrease but scale with cell volume.},

abstract = {Cytoplasmic linker associated proteins (CLASPs) comprise a class of microtubule (MT) plus end-binding proteins (+TIPs) that contribute to the dynamics and organization of MTs during many cellular processes, among them mitosis. Human CLASP proteins contain multiple MT-binding domains, including tumor over-expressed gene (TOG) domains, and a Ser-x-Ile-Pro (SxIP) motif known to target some +TIPs though interaction with end-binding protein 1 (EB1). However, how individual domains contribute to CLASP function is poorly understood. We generated full-length recombinant human CLASP1 and a series of truncation mutants and found that two N-terminal TOG domains make the strongest contribution to MT polymerization and bundling, but also identified a third TOG domain that further contributes to CLASP activity. Plus end tracking by CLASP requires the SxIP motif and interaction with EB1. The C-terminal coiled-coil domain mediates dimerization and association with many other factors, including the kinetochore motor centromere protein E (CENP-E), and the chromokinesin Xkid. Only the full-length protein was able to rescue spindle assembly in Xenopus egg extracts depleted of endogenous CLASP. Deletion of the C-terminal domain caused aberrant MT polymerization and dramatic spindle phenotypes, even with small amounts of added protein, indicating that proper localization of CLASP activity is essential to control MT polymerization during mitosis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The mitotic spindle assembles into a bipolar, microtubule-based protein machine during prometaphase. One proposed mechanism for this process is "search-and-capture," in which dynamically unstable microtubules (MTs) search space to capture chromosomes [1]. Although existing theoretical estimates [2, 3] suggest that dynamic instability is efficient enough to allow capture within characteristic mitotic timescales, they are limited in scope and do not address the capture times for realistic numbers of chromosomes. Here we used mathematical modeling to explore this issue. We show that without any bias toward the chromosomes, search-and-capture is not efficient enough to explain the typical observed duration of prometaphase. We further analyze search-and-capture in the presence of a spatial gradient of a stabilizing factor [4-6] that biases MT dynamics toward the chromosomes. We show theoretically that such biased search-and-capture is efficient enough to account for chromosome capture. We also show that additional factors must contribute to accelerate the spindle assembly for cells with large nuclear volumes. We discuss the possibility that a RanGTP gradient introduces a spatial bias into microtubule dynamics and thus improves the efficiency of search-and-capture as a mechanism for spindle assembly. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate the biological role of Antxr2, we generated Antxr2-/- mice. Antxr2-/- mice were viable, however Antxr2 is required for parturition in young females and for preserving fertility in older female mice. Histological analysis of the uterus and cervix revealed aberrant deposition of extracellular matrix proteins such as type I collagen, type VI collagen and fibronectin. A marked disruption of both the circular and longitudinal myometrial cell layers was evident in Antxr2-/- mice. These changes progressed as the mice aged, resulting in a thickened, collagen dense, acellular stroma and the disappearance of normal uterine architecture. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the uterine fibrosis we performed immunoblotting for MMP2 using uterine lysates and zymography using conditioned medium from Antxr2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts and found reduced levels of activated MMP2 in both. This prompted us to investigate MT1-MMP status, as MMP2 processing is regulated by MT1-MMP. We found MT1-MMP activity, as measured by MMP2 processing and activation, was enhanced by expression of either ANTXR1 or ANTXR2. We identified an ANTXR2/MT1-MMP complex and demonstrated that MT1-MMP activity is dependent on ANTXR2 expression levels in cells. Thus, we have discovered that ANTXR1 and ANTXR2 function as positive regulators of MT1-MMP activity.},

Disruption of the FEAR pathway results in defects in anaphase, including alterations in the assembly and behavior of the anaphase spindle. Many phenotypes of slk19$\Delta$ mutants are consistent with a loss of FEAR signaling, but other phenotypes suggest that Slk19p may have FEAR-independent roles in modulating the behavior of microtubules in anaphase. Here, a series of SLK19 in-frame deletion mutations were used to test whether Slk19p has distinct roles in anaphase that can be ascribed to specific regions of the protein. Separation-of-function alleles were identified that are defective for either FEAR signaling or aspects of anaphase spindle function. The data suggest that in early anaphase one region of Slk19p is essential for FEAR signaling, while later in anaphase another region is critical for maintaining the coordination between spindle elongation and the growth of interpolar microtubules.

abstract = {Two Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinesin-related motors, Cin8p and Kip1p, perform an essential role in the separation of spindle poles during spindle assembly and a major role in spindle elongation. Cin8p and Kip1p are also required to prevent an inward spindle collapse prior to anaphase. A third kinesin-related motor, Kar3p, may act antagonistically to Cin8p and Kip1p since loss of Kar3p partially suppresses the spindle collapse in cin8 kip1 mutants. We have tested the relationship between Cin8p and Kar3p by overexpressing both motors using the inducible GALl promoter. Overexpression of KAR3 results in a shrinkage of spindle size and a temperature-dependent inhibition of the growth of wild-type cells. Excess Kar3p has a stronger inhibitory effect on the growth of cin8 kip1 mutants and can completely block anaphase spindle elongation in these cells. In contrast, overexpression of CIN8 leads to premature spindle elongation in all cells tested. This is the first direct demonstration of antagonistic motors acting on the intact spindle and suggests that spindle length is determined by the relative activity of Kar3p-like and Cin8p/Kip1p-like motors.},

abstract = {Spindle pole biogenesis and segregation are tightly coordinated to produce a bipolar mitotic spindle. In yeasts, the spindle pole body (SPB) half-bridge composed of Sfi1 and Cdc31 duplicates to promote the biogenesis of a second SPB. Sfi1 accumulates at the half-bridge in two phases in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, from anaphase to early septation and throughout G2 phase. We found that the function of Sfi1-Cdc31 in SPB duplication is accomplished before septation ends and G2 accumulation starts. Thus, Sfi1 early accumulation at mitotic exit might correspond to half-bridge duplication. We further show that Cdc31 phosphorylation on serine 15 in a Cdk1 (encoded by cdc2) consensus site is required for the dissociation of a significant pool of Sfi1 from the bridge and timely segregation of SPBs at mitotic onset. This suggests that the Cdc31 N-terminus modulates the stability of Sfi1-Cdc31 arrays in fission yeast, and impacts on the timing of establishment of spindle bipolarity.},

abstract = {In cells, many vital processes involve myosin-driven motility that actively remodels the actin cytoskeleton and changes cell shape. Here we study how the collective action of myosin motors organizes actin filaments into contractile structures in a simplified model system devoid of biochemical regulation. We show that this self-organization occurs through an active multistage coarsening process. First, motors form dense foci by moving along the actin network structure followed by coalescence. Then the foci accumulate actin filaments in a shell around them. These actomyosin condensates eventually cluster due to motor-driven coalescence. We propose that the physical origin of this multistage aggregation is the highly asymmetric load response of actin filaments: they can support large tensions but buckle easily under piconewton compressive loads. Because the motor-generated forces well exceed this threshold, buckling is induced on the connected actin network that resists motor-driven filament sliding. We show how this buckling can give rise to the accumulation of actin shells around myosin foci and subsequent coalescence of foci into superaggregates. This new physical mechanism provides an explanation for the formation and contractile dynamics of disordered condensed actomyosin states observed in vivo.},

abstract = {The force the spindle exerts on a single moving chromosome in anaphase was measured with a flexible glass needle calibrated in dynes per micron of tip deflection. The needle was used to produce a force on the chromosome, which opposed that produced by the spindle and was measurable from needle tip deflection. The measurements were made in intact grasshopper spermatocytes after proving that the presence of materials such as the cell surface did not interfere. The results from 12 experiments in seven cells are as follows: Chromosome velocity was not affected until the opposing force reached approximately 10(-5) dyn, and then fell rapidly with increasing force. The opposing force that caused chromosome velocity to fall to zero--the force that matched the maximum force the spindle could produce--was of order 7 X 10(-5) dyn. This directly measured maximum force potential is nearly 10,000 times greater than the calculated value of 10(-8) dyn for normal chromosome movement, in which only viscous resistance to movement must be overcome. The spindle's unexpectedly large force potential prompts a fresh look at molecular models for the mitotic motor, at velocity-limiting governors, and at the possibility that force may sometimes affect microtubule length and stability.},

abstract = {By proteolytic modification of low abundant signaling proteins and membrane receptors, proteases exert potent posttranslational control over cell behavior at the postsecretion level. Hence, substrate discovery is indispensable for understanding the biological role of proteases in vivo. Indeed, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), long associated with extracellular matrix degradation, are increasingly recognized as important processing enzymes of bioactive molecules. MS is now the primary proteomic technique for detecting, identifying, and quantitating proteins in cells or tissues. Here we used isotopecoded affinity tag labeling and multidimensional liquid chromatography inline with tandem MS to identify MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell proteins shed from the cell surface or the pericellular matrix and extracellular proteins that were degraded or processed after transfection with human membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP). Potential substrates were identified as those having altered protein levels compared with the E240A inactive MT1-MMP mutant or vector transfectants. New substrates were biochemically confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight MS and Edman sequencing of cleavage fragments after incubation with recombinant soluble MT1-MMP in vitro. We report many previously uncharacterized substrates of MT1-MMP, including the neutrophil chemokine IL-8, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, pro-tumor necrosis factor alpha, death receptor-6, and connective tissue growth factor, indicating that MT1-MMP is an important signaling protease in addition to its traditionally ascribed roles in pericellular matrix remodeling. Moreover, the high-throughput and quantitative nature of isotope-coded affinity tag labeling combined with tandem MS sequencing is a previously undescribed degradomic screen for protease substrate discovery that should be generally adaptable to other classes of protease for exploring proteolytic function in complex and dynamic biological contexts.},

However, how MT polymerization cycles are produced and spatiotemporally regulated at a molecular level is unclear, as the entire cycle has not been recapitulated in vitro with defined components. In this study, we reconstituted dynamic MT plus end behavior involving all three phases by mixing tubulin with five Drosophila melanogaster proteins (EB1, XMAP215Msps, Sentin, kinesin-13Klp10A, and CLASPMast/Orbit). When singly mixed with tubulin, CLASPMast/Orbit strongly inhibited MT catastrophe and reduced the growth rate. However, in the presence of the other four factors, CLASPMast/Orbit acted as an inducer of pausing. The mitotic kinase Plk1Polo modulated the activity of CLA SPMast/Orbit and kinesin-13Klp10A and increased the dynamic instability of MTs, reminiscent of mitotic cells. These results suggest that five conserved proteins constitute the core factors for creating dynamic MTs in cells and that Plk1-dependent phosphorylation is a crucial event for switching from the interphase to mitotic mode.},

abstract = {Proper bipolar spindle assembly underlies accurate chromosome segregation. A cohort of microtubule-associated proteins orchestrates spindle microtubule formation in a spatiotemporally coordinated manner. Among them, the conserved XMAP215/TOG family of microtubule polymerase plays a central role in spindle assembly. In fission yeast, two XMAP215/TOG members, Alp14 and Dis1, share essential roles in cell viability; however how these two proteins functionally collaborate remains undetermined. Here we show the functional interplay and specification of Alp14 and Dis1. Creation of new mutant alleles of alp14, which display temperature sensitivity in the absence of Dis1, enabled us to conduct detailed analyses of a double mutant. We have found that simultaneous inactivation of Alp14 and Dis1 results in early mitotic arrest with very short, fragile spindles. Intriguingly, these cells often undergo spindle collapse, leading to a lethal “cut” phenotype. By implementing an artificial targeting system, we have shown that Alp14 and Dis1 are not functionally exchangeable and as such are not merely redundant paralogues. Interestingly, while Alp14 promotes microtubule nucleation, Dis1 does not. Our results uncover that the intrinsic specification, not the spatial regulation, between Alp14 and Dis1 underlies the collaborative actions of these two XMAP215/TOG members in mitotic progression, spindle integrity and genome stability.},

abstract = {Accurate chromosome segregation relies on the bipolar mitotic spindle. In many eukaryotes, spindle formation is driven by the plus-end directed motor Kinesin-5 that generates outward force to establish spindle bipolarity. Its inhibition leads to the emergence of monopolar spindles with mitotic arrest. Intriguingly, simultaneous inactivation of the minus-end directed motor Kinesin-14 restores spindle bipolarity in many systems. Here we show that in fission yeast, three independent pathways contribute to spindle bipolarity in the absence of Kinesin-5/Cut7 and Kinesin-14/Pkl1. One is Kinesin-6/Klp9 that engages with spindle elongation once short bipolar spindles assemble. Klp9 also ensures the medial positioning of anaphase spindles to prevent unequal chromosome segregation. Another is the Alp7/TACC-Alp14/TOG microtubule polymerase complex. Temperature sensitive alp7cut7pkl1 mutants are arrested with either monopolar or very short spindles. Forced targeting of Alp14 to the spindle pole body is sufficient to render alp7cut7pkl1 triply-deleted cells viable and promote spindle assembly, indicating that Alp14-mediated microtubule polymerization from the nuclear face of the spindle pole body could generate outward force in place of Cut7 during early mitosis. The third pathway involves the Ase1/PRC1 microtubule crosslinker that stabilizes antiparallel microtubules. Our study, therefore, unveils multifaceted interplay among kinesin-dependent and -independent pathways leading to mitotic bipolar spindle assembly.},

Quantitative changes during the cell cycle were infrequent and weak in the proteome but prominent in the phosphoproteome. Protein phosphorylation peaked in mitosis, where the median phosphorylation site occupancy was 44{\%}, about 2-fold higher than in other phases. We measured copy numbers of 3178 proteins, which together with phosphorylation site stoichiometry enabled us to estimate the absolute amount of protein-bound phosphate, as well as its change across the cell cycle. Our results indicate that 23{\%} of the average intracellular ATP is utilized by protein kinases to phosphorylate their substrates to drive regulatory processes during cell division. Accordingly, we observe that phosphate transporters and phosphate-metabolizing enzymes are phosphorylated and therefore likely to be regulated in mitosis.},

In this review, we describe recent findings on the multiple pathways leading to bipolar spindle formation in fission yeast and discuss these results from a broader perspective. The roles of three mitotic kinesins (Kinesin-5, Kinesin-6 and Kinesin-14) in spindle assembly are depicted, and how a group of microtubule-associated proteins, sister chromatid cohesion and the kinetochore collaborate with these motors is shown. We have paid special attention to the molecular pathways that render otherwise essential Kinesin-5 to become non-essential: how cells build bipolar mitotic spindles without the need for Kinesin-5 and where the alternate forces come from are considered. We highlight the force balance for bipolar spindle assembly and explain how outward and inward forces are generated by various ways, in which the proper fine-tuning of microtubule dynamics plays a crucial role. Overall, these new pathways have illuminated the remarkable plasticity and adaptability of spindle mechanics. Kinesin molecules are regarded as prospective targets for cancer chemotherapy and many specific inhibitors have been developed. However, several hurdles have arisen against their clinical implementation. This review provides insight into possible strategies to overcome these challenges.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {TOGp, a member of the XMAP215 MAP family, is required for bipolar mitotic spindle assembly. To understand how TOGp contributes to spindle assembly, we examined microtubule dynamics after depleting TOGp by siRNA. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of GFP-tubulin demonstrated that spindle microtubule turnover is slowed two-fold in the absence of TOGp. Consistent with photobleaching results, microtubule regrowth after washout of the microtubule depolymerizing drug nocodazole was slower at the centrosomes and in the vicinity of mitotic chromatin in cells depleted of TOGp. The slower microtubule turnover is likely due to either nucleation or the transitions of dynamic instability because TOGp depletion did not effect the rate of plus end growth, measured by tracking EB1-GFP at microtubule ends. In contrast, microtubule regrowth after nocodazole washout was unaffected by prior depletion of TACC3, a centrosomal protein that interacts with TOGp. Kinetochore fibers in both untreated and TOGp-depleted cells were stable to incubation at 4°C or lysis in buffer containing calcium indicating that stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments are formed in the absence of TOGp. Depletion of TOGp, but not TACC3, reduced kinetochore oscillations during prometaphase/metaphase. Defects in oscillations are not due simply to multipolarity or loss of centrosome focus in the TOGp-depleted cells, since kinetochore oscillations appear normal in cells treated with the proteosome inhibitor MG132, which also results in multipolar spindles and centrosome fragmentation. We hypothesize that TOGp is required for chromosome motility as a downstream consequence of reduced microtubule dynamics and/or density. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Microbes typically exist in mixed communities and display complex synergistic and antagonistic interactions. The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is widespread in Gram-negative bacteria and represents a contractile nano-machine that can fire effector proteins directly into neighbouring cells. The primary role assigned to the T6SS is to function as a potent weapon during inter-bacterial competition, delivering antibacterial effectors into rival bacterial cells. However, it has recently emerged that the T6SS can also be used as a powerful weapon against fungal competitors, and the first fungal-specific T6SS effector proteins, Tfe1 and Tfe2, have been identified. These effectors act via distinct mechanisms against a variety of fungal species to cause cell death. Tfe1 intoxication triggers plasma membrane depolarisation, whilst Tfe2 disrupts nutrient uptake and induces autophagy. Based on the frequent coexistence of bacteria and fungi in microbial communities, we propose that T6SS-dependent antifungal activity is likely to be widespread and elicited by a suite of antifungal effectors. Supporting this hypothesis, homologues of Tfe1 and Tfe2 are found in other bacterial species, and a number of T6SS-elaborating species have been demonstrated to interact with fungi. Thus, we envisage that antifungal T6SS will shape many polymicrobial communities, including the human microbiota and disease-causing infections.},

Here, we employ an optical-trap- and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF)-based assay to show that ensembles of kinesin-5, a conserved mitotic motor protein, can push apart overlapping antiparallel microtubules to generate a force whose magnitude scales with filament overlap length. We also find that kinesin-5 can produce overlap-length-dependent "brake-like" resistance against relative microtubule sliding in both parallel and antiparallel geometries, an activity that has been suggested by cell biological studies but had not been directly measured. Together, these findings, along with numerical simulations, reveal how a motor protein can function as an analog converter, "reading" simple geometric and dynamic features in cytoskeletal networks to produce regulated force outputs.},

This labeling approach is unique in that it allows myoVa, instead of its cargo, to be tracked. Single-particle analysis showed short periods (???0.5 s) of ATP-sensitive linear motion. The mean velocity of these trajectories was 604 nm/s and independent of the number of myoVa molecules attached to the Qdot. With high time (16.6 ms) and spatial (15 nm) resolution imaging, Qdot-labeled myoVa moved with sequential 75 nm steps per head, at a rate of 16 s-1, similarly to myoVa in vitro.

Using a systems biology approach, we built a robust minimal computational model to comprehend mitotic events in dividing budding yeasts of two major phyla: Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. This model accurately reproduces experimental observations related to spindle alignment, nuclear migration, and microtubule (MT) dynamics during cell division in these yeasts. The model converges to the conclusion that biased nucleation of cytoplasmic microtubules (cMTs) is essential for directional nuclear migration. Two distinct pathways, based on the population of cMTs and cortical dyneins, differentiate nuclear migration and spindle orientation in these two phyla. In addition, the model accurately predicts the contribution of specific classes of MTs in chromosome segregation. Thus we present a model that offers a wider applicability to simulate the effects of perturbation of an event on the concerted process of the mitotic cell division.},

Currently, we have a limited understanding of how geometrical properties of microtubule arrays, in turn, regulate the output of crosslinking proteins. Here we investigate this problem in the context of microtubule sliding by two interacting proteins: the non-motor crosslinker PRC1 and the kinesin Kif4A. The collective activity of PRC1 and Kif4A also results in their accumulation at microtubule plus-ends (‘end-tag'). Sliding stalls when the end-tags on antiparallel microtubules collide, forming a stable overlap. Interestingly, we find that structural properties of the initial array regulate PRC1-Kif4A mediated microtubule organization. First, sliding velocity scales with initial microtubule-overlap length. Second, the width of the final overlap scales with microtubule lengths. Our analyses reveal how micron-scale geometrical features of antiparallel microtubules can regulate the activity of nanometer-sized proteins to define the structure and mechanics of microtubule-based architectures.},

We show that, even though mitotic and meiotic spindles underwent the typical three phases of spindle elongation, they have distinct features. We found that the relative concentration of the kinesin-14 family protein Pkl1 is decreased in meiosis I compared to mitosis, while the concentration of the kinesin-5 family protein Cut7 remains constant. We identified the second kinesin-14 family protein Klp2 and microtubule dynamics as factors necessary for proper meiotic spindle assembly.

abstract = {The role of GTP hydrolysis in microtubule dynamics has been reinvestigated using an analogue of GTP, guanylyl-($\alpha$,$\beta$)-methylene-diphosphonate (GMPCPP). This analogue binds to the tubulin exchangeable nucleotide binding site (E- site) with an affinity four to eightfold lower than GTP and promotes the polymerization of normal microtubules. The polymerization rate of microtubules with GMPCPP-tubulin is very similar to that of GTP-tubulin. However, in contrast to microtubules polymerized with GTP, GMPCPP- microtubules do not depolymerize rapidly after isothermal dilution. The depolymerization rate of GMPCPP-microtubules is 0.1 s-1 compared with 500 s-1 for GDP-microtubules. GMPCPP also completely suppresses dynamic instability. Contrary to previous work, we find that the $\beta$-$\gamma$ bond of GMPCPP is hydrolyzed extremely slowly after incorporation into the microtubule lattice, with a rate constant of 4 x 10-7 s-1. Because GMPCPP hydrolysis is negligible over the course of a polymerization experiment, it can be used to test the role of hydrolysis in microtubule dynamics. Our results provide strong new evidence for the idea that GTP hydrolysis by tubulin is not required for normal polymerization but is essential for depolymerization and thus for dynamic instability. Because GMPCPP strongly promotes spontaneous nucleation of microtubules, we propose that GTP hydrolysis by tubulin also plays the important biological role of inhibiting spontaneous microtubule nucleation.},

abstract = {During cell division, chromosome segregation is governed by the interaction of spindle microtubules with the kinetochore. A dramatic remodeling of interpolar microtubules into an organized central spindle between the separating chromatids is required for the initiation and execution of cytokinesis. Central spindle organization requires mitotic kinesins, microtubule-bundling protein PRC1, and Aurora B kinase complex. However, the precise role of PRC1 in central spindle organization has remained elusive. Here we show that PRC1 recruits CLASP1 to the central spindle at early anaphase onset. CLASP1 belongs to a conserved microtubule-binding protein family that mediates the stabilization of overlapping microtubules of the central spindle. PRC1 physically interacts with CLASP1 and specifies its localization to the central spindle. Repression of CLASP1 leads to sister-chromatid bridges and depolymerization of spindle midzone microtubules. Disruption of PRC1-CLASP1 interaction by a membrane-permeable peptide abrogates accurate chromosome segregation, resulting in sister chromatid bridges. These findings reveal a key role for the PRC1-CLASP1 interaction in achieving a stable anti-parallel microtubule organization essential for faithful chromosome segregation. We propose that PRC1 forms a link between stabilization of CLASP1 association with central spindle microtubules and anti-parallel microtubule elongation.},

abstract = {Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mal3 is a member of the EB family of proteins, which are proposed to be core elements in a tiptracking network that regulates microtubule dynamics in cells. How Mal3 itself influences microtubule dynamics is unclear. We tested the effects of full-length recombinant Mal3 on dynamic microtubules assembled in vitro from purified S. pombe tubulin, using dark field video microscopy to avoid fluorescent tagging and data-averaging techniques to improve spatiotemporal resolution. We find that catastrophe occurs stochastically as a fast ({\textless}2.2 s) transition from constant speed growth to constant speed shrinkage with a constant probability that is independent of the Mal3 concentration. This implies that Mal3 neither stabilizes nor destabilizes microtubule tips. Mal3 does, however, stabilize the main part of the microtubule lattice, inhibiting shrinkage and increasing the frequency of rescues, consistent with recent models in which Mal3 on the lattice forms stabilizing lateral links between neighboring protofilaments. At high concentrations, Mal3 can entirely block shrinkage and induce very rapid rescue, making catastrophes impossible to detect, which may account for the apparent suppression of catastrophe by Mal3 and other EBs in vivo. Overall, we find that Mal3 stabilizes microtubules not by preventing catastrophe at the microtubule tip but by inhibiting lattice depolymerization and enhancing rescue. We argue that this implies that Mal3 binds microtubules in different modes at the tip and on the lattice. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

Proper length control of the metaphase mitotic spindle is critical to this process and is thought to be achieved through a mechanism in which spindle pole separation forces from plus-end-directed motors are balanced by forces from minus-end-directed motors that pull spindle poles together. However, in contrast to this model, metaphase mitotic spindles with inactive kinesin-14 minus-end-directed motors often have shorter spindle lengths, along with poorly aligned spindle microtubules. A mechanistic explanation for this paradox is unknown. Using computational modeling, in vitro reconstitution, live-cell fluorescence microscopy, and electron microscopy, we now find that the budding yeast kinesin-14 molecular motor Kar3-Cik1 can efficiently align spindle microtubules along the spindle axis.

Here, we describe a regulatory mechanism involving direct binding between tail and motor domains and its fundamental role in microtubule sliding. Kinesin-5 tails decrease microtubule-stimulated ATP-hydrolysis by specifically engaging motor domains in the nucleotide-free or ADP states. Cryo-EM reveals that tail binding stabilizes an open motor domain ATP-active site. Full-length motors undergo slow motility and cluster together along microtubules, while tail-deleted motors exhibit rapid motility without clustering. The tail is critical for motors to zipper together two microtubules by generating substantial sliding forces. The tail is essential for mitotic spindle localization, which becomes severely reduced in tail-deleted motors. Our studies suggest a revised microtubule-sliding model, in which kinesin-5 tails stabilize motor domains microtubule-bound states by slowing ATP-binding resulting in high-force production at both homotetramer ends.},

abstract = {Naturally occurring groups of muscle myosin behave differently from individual myosins or small groups commonly assayed in vitro. Here, we investigate the emergence of myosin group behavior with increasing myosin group size. Assuming the number of myosin binding sites (N) is proportional to actin length (L) (N = L/35.5 nm), we resolve in vitro motility of actin propelled by skeletal muscle myosin for L = 0.2-3 $\mu$m. Three distinct regimes were found: L {\textless} 0.3 $\mu$m, sliding arrest; 0.3 $\mu$m ≤ L ≤ 1 $\mu$m, alternation between arrest and continuous sliding; L {\textgreater} 1 $\mu$m, continuous sliding. We theoretically investigated the myosin group kinetics with mechanical coupling via actin. We find rapid actin sliding steps driven by power-stroke cascades supported by postpower-stroke myosins, and phases without actin sliding caused by prepower-stroke myosin buildup. The three regimes are explained: N = 8, rare cascades; N = 15, cascade bursts; N = 35, continuous cascading. Two saddle-node bifurcations occur for increasing N (mono → bi → mono-stability), with steady states corresponding to arrest and continuous cascading. The experimentally measured dependence of actin sliding statistics on L and myosin concentration is correctly predicted. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biophysical Society.},

Advances in proteomics techniques and studies in model organisms have identified hundreds of proteins that localize to the NE. However, the function of many of these proteins at the NE remains unclear, in part due to a lack of understanding of the interactions that these proteins participate in at the NE membrane. To assist in the characterization of NE transmembrane protein interactions we developed an arrayed library of integral and peripheral membrane proteins from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe for high-throughput screening using the split-ubiquitin based membrane yeast two -hybrid system. We used this approach to characterize protein interactions for three conserved proteins that localize to the inner nuclear membrane: Cut11/Ndc1, Lem2 and Ima1/Samp1/ Net5. Additionally, we determined how the interaction network for Cut11 is altered in canonical temperature-sensitive cut11-ts mutants. This library and screening approach is readily applicable to characterizing the interactomes of integral membrane proteins localizing to various subcellular compartments.},

External forces can influence the behavior of kinesin, and force-velocity curves have shown that the motor will slow down and eventually stall under opposing loads of5 pN. Using an in vitro motility assay in conjunction with a high-resolution optical trapping microscope, we have examined the behavior of individual kinesin molecules under two previously unexplored loading regimes: super-stall loads ({\textgreater}5 pN) and forward (plus-end directed) loads. Whereas some theories of kinesin function predict a reversal of directionality under high loads, we found that kinesin does not walk backwards under loads of up to 13 pN, probably because of an irreversible transition in the mechanical cycle. We also found that this cycle can be significantly accelerated by forward loads under a wide range of ATP concentrations. Finally, we noted an increase in kinesin's rate of dissociation from the microtubule with increasing load, which is consistent with a load dependent partitioning between two recently described kinetic pathways: a coordinated-head pathway (which leads to stepping) and an independent-head pathway (which is static).},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The mitotic spindle is an ensemble of microtubules responsible for the repartition of the chromosomal content between the two daughter cells during division. In metazoans, spindle assembly is a gradual process involving dynamic microtubules and recruitment of numerous associated proteins and motors. During mitosis, centrosomes organize and nucleate the majority of spindle microtubules. In contrast, oocytes lack canonical centrosomes but are still able to form bipolar spindles, starting from an initial ball that self-organizes in several hours. Interfering with early steps of meiotic spindle assembly can lead to erroneous chromosome segregation. Although not fully elucidated, this process is known to rely on antagonistic activities of plus end– and minus end–directed motors. We developed a model of early meiotic spindle assembly in mouse oocytes, including key factors such as microtubule dynamics and chromosome movement. We explored how the balance between plus end– and minus end–directed motors, as well as the influence of microtubule nucleation, impacts spindle morphology. In a refined model, we added spatial regulation of microtubule stability and minus-end clustering. We could reproduce the features of early stages of spindle assembly from 12 different experimental perturbations and predict eight additional perturbations. With its ability to characterize and predict chromosome individualization, this model can help deepen our understanding of spindle assembly.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {During mitosis, ensembles of dynamic MTs and motors exert forces that coordinate chromosome segregation. Typically, chromosomes align at the metaphase spindle equator where they oscillate along the pole-pole axis before disjoining and moving poleward during anaphase A, but spindles in different cell types display differences in MT dynamicity, in the amplitude of chromosome oscillations and in rates of chromatid-to-pole motion. Drosophila embryonic mitotic spindles, for example, display remarkably dynamic MTs, barely detectable metaphase chromosome oscillations, and a rapid rate of "flux-pacman- dependent" anaphase chromatid-to-pole motility. Here we develop a force-balance model that describes Drosophila embryo chromosome motility in terms of a balance of forces acting on kinetochores and kMTs that is generated by multiple polymer ratchets and mitotic motors coupled to tension-dependent kMT dynamics. The model shows that i), multiple MTs displaying high dynamic instability can drive steady and rapid chromosome motion; ii), chromosome motility during metaphase and anaphase A can be described by a single mechanism; iii), high kinetochore dynein activity is deployed to dampen metaphase oscillations, to augment the basic flux-pacman mechanism, and to drive rapid anaphase A; iv), modulation of the MT rescue frequency by the kinetochore-associated kinesin-13 depolymerase promotes metaphase chromosome oscillations; and v), this basic mechanism can be adapted to a broad range of spindles. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Biophysical Society.},
annote = {Here the length is fixed!!!

The new addition of this one is that the previous model did not take into account attachment (In Gardner 2005 kinetochores are always linked to the plus ends)

Here there is poleward flux.

Also a bit more complicated, the microtubule can push the kinetochore, and there are also motors at the kinetochore that pull or push the kinetochore

What is polar ejection?

They consider that poleward flux/depolymerisation matches the speed at which minus ends are being dragged into the pole.

Read Maiato et al. , references 13-47

Basically same conculsions, you need the force dependent microtubule dynamics. In addition they take into account what happens when you increase dynein. In this case what this does is pull the chromsome towards the 

VERY important point. Yeast cells do not have kinesin-13 nor poleward flux.},

We investigated Kip3's role in this process using semi-automated, quantitative fluorescence microscopy and time-lapse imaging and found that Kip3 is required for congression. Deletion of KIP3 increases inter-kinetochore distances and increases the variability in the position of sister kinetochores along the spindle axis during metaphase. Kip3 does not regulate spindle length and is not required for kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Instead, Kip3 clusters kinetochores on the metaphase spindle by tightly regulating kinetochore microtubule lengths. {\textcopyright} 2010 Landes Bioscience.},

We introduce a simple model for the competition between the stochastic dynamics of elastic bonds at the moving interface and relaxation within the moving actin cytoskeleton represented by an internal viscous friction coefficient. Using exact stochastic simulations and an analytical mean field theory, we show that the stochastic bond dynamics lead to biphasic friction laws as observed experimentally. At low internal dissipation, stochastic bond dynamics lead to a regime of irregular stick-and-slip motion. High internal dissipation effectively suppresses cooperative effects among bonds and hence stabilizes the adhesion.},

abstract = {Cells actively produce contractile forces for a variety of processes including cytokinesis and motility. Contractility is known to rely on myosin II motors which convert chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into forces on actin filaments. However, the basic physical principles of cell contractility remain poorly understood. We reconstitute contractility in a simplified model system of purified F-actin, muscle myosin II motors, and alpha-actinin cross-linkers. We show that contractility occurs above a threshold motor concentration and within a window of cross-linker concentrations. We also quantify the pore size of the bundled networks and find contractility to occur at a critical distance between the bundles. We propose a simple mechanism of contraction based on myosin filaments pulling neighboring bundles together into an aggregated structure. Observations of this reconstituted system in both bulk and low-dimensional geometries show that the contracting gels pull on and deform their surface with a contractile force of approximately 1 microN, or approximately 100 pN per F-actin bundle. Cytoplasmic extracts contracting in identical environments show a similar behavior and dependence on myosin as the reconstituted system. Our results suggest that cellular contractility can be sensitively regulated by tuning the (local) activity of molecular motors and the cross-linker density and binding affinity.},

abstract = {In C. elegans one-cell embryos, polarity is conventionally defined along the anteroposterior axis by the segregation of partitioning-defective (PAR) proteins into anterior (PAR-3, PAR-6) and posterior (PAR-1, PAR-2) cortical domains. The establishment of PAR asymmetry is coupled with acto-myosin cytoskeleton rearrangements. The small GTPases RHO-1 and CDC-42 are key players in cytoskeletal remodeling and cell polarity in a number of different systems. We investigated the roles of these two GTPases and the RhoGEF ECT-2 in polarity establishment in C. elegans embryos. We show that CDC-42 is required to remove PAR-2 from the cortex at the end of meiosis and to localize PAR-6 to the cortex. By contrast, RHO-1 activity is required to facilitate the segregation of CDC-42 and PAR-6 to the anterior. Loss of RHO-1 activity causes defects in the early organization of the myosin cytoskeleton but does not inhibit segregation of myosin to the anterior. We therefore propose that RHO-1 couples the polarization of the acto-myosin cytoskeleton with the proper segregation of CDC-42, which, in turn, localizes PAR-6 to the anterior cortex.},

abstract = {Vertebrate gastrulation entails massive cell movements that establish and shape the germ layers. During gastrulation, the individual cell behaviors are strictly coordinated in time and space by various signaling pathways. These pathways instruct the cells about proliferation, shape, fate and migration into proper location. Convergence and extension (C{\&}E) movements during vertebrate gastrulation play a major role in the shaping of the embryonic body. In vertebrates, the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (Wnt/PCP) pathway is a key regulator of C{\&}E movements, essential for several polarized cell behaviors, including directed cell migration, and mediolateral and radial cell intercalation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of Planar Cell Polarity by highly dynamic mesenchymal cells engaged in C{\&}E are still not well understood. Here we review new evidence implicating the Wnt/PCP pathway in specific cell behaviors required for C{\&}E during zebrafish gastrulation, in comparison to other vertebrates. We also discuss findings on the molecular regulation and the interaction of the Wnt/PCP pathway with other signaling pathways during gastrulation movements.},

abstract = {We have isolated a protein factor from Xenopus eggs that promotes microtubule assembly in vitro. Assembly promotion was associated with a 215-kD protein after a 1,000-3,000-fold enrichment of activity. The 215-kD protein, termed Xenopus microtubule assembly protein (XMAP), binds to microtubules with a stoichiometry of 0.06 mol/mol tubulin dimer. XMAP is immunologically distinct from the Xenopus homologues to mammalian brain microtubule-associated proteins; however, protein species immunologically related to XMAP with different molecular masses are found in Xenopus neuronal tissues and testis. XMAP is unusual in that it specifically promotes microtubule assembly at the plus-end. At a molar ratio of 0.01 mol XMAP/mol tubulin the assembly rate of the microtubule plus-end is accelerated 8-fold while the assembly rate of the minus-end is increased only 1.8-fold. Under these conditions XMAP promotes a 10-fold increase in the on-rate constant (from 1.4 s-1{\textperiodcentered}$\mu$M-1 for microtubules assembled from pure tubulin to 15 s-1{\textperiodcentered}$\mu$M-1), and a 10-fold decrease in off-rate constant (from 340 to 34 s-1). Given its stoichiometry in vivo, XMAP must be the major microtubule assembly factor in the Xenopus egg. XMAP is phosphorylated during M-phase of both meiotic and mitotic cycles, suggesting that its activity may be regulated during the cell cycle.},

abstract = {A previously uncharacterized yeast gene (YER016w) that we have named BIM1 (binding to microtubules) was obtained from a two-hybrid screen of a yeast cDNA library using as bait the entire coding sequence of TUB1 (encoding $\alpha$-tubulin). Deletion of BIM1 results in a strong bilateral karyogamy defect, hypersensitivity to benomyl, and aberrant spindle behavior, all phenotypes associated with mutations affecting microtubules in yeast, and inviability at extreme temperatures (i.e., ≤37°C or ≤14°C). Overexpression of BIM1 in wild-type cells is lethal. A fusion of Bim1p with green fluorescent protein that complements the bim1$\Delta$ phenotypes allows visualization in vivo of both intranuclear spindles and extranuclear microtubules in otherwise wild-type cells. A bim1 deletion displays synthetic lethality with deletion alleles of bik1, num1, and bub3 as well as a limited subset of tub1 conditional-lethal alleles. A systematic study of 51 tub1 alleles suggests a correlation between specific failure to interact with Bim1p in the two-hybrid assay and synthetic lethality with the bim1$\Delta$ allele. The sequence of BIM1 shows substantial similarity to sequences from organisms across the evolutionary spectrum. One of the human homologues, EB1, has been reported previously as binding APC, itself a microtubule-binding protein and the product of a gene implicated in the etiology of human colon cancer.},

We have found that causing fertilisation to occur in the abnormal end of the egg completely reverses the orientation of the anteroposterior axis, but gives otherwise normal development. This result suggests that a component of the sperm normally specifies the anteroposterior axis. We have found that a cytoplasmic rearrangement in the uncleaved zygote is directed by the sperm, suggesting a mechanism by which the sperm may specify the axis.

We show that an MKlp2-dependent pool of Aurora B at the central spindle, rather than global Aurora B activity, regulates KIF4A accumulation at the central spindle. KIF4A phosphorylation by Aurora B stimulates the maximal microtubule-dependent ATPase activity of KIF4A and promotes its interaction with PRC1. In the presence of phosphorylated KIF4A, microtubules grew more slowly and showed long pauses in growth, resulting in the generation of shorter PRC1-stabilized microtubule overlaps in vitro. Cells expressing only mutant forms of KIF4A lacking the Aurora B phosphorylation site overextended the anaphase central spindle, demonstrating that this regulation is crucial for microtubule length control in vivo. Aurora B therefore ensures that suppression of microtubule dynamic instability by KIF4A is restricted to a specific subset of microtubules and thereby contributes to central spindle size control in anaphase.},

abstract = {Bipolar spindles must separate chromosomes by the appropriate distance during cell division, but mechanisms determining spindle length are poorly understood. Based on a 2D model of meiotic spindle assembly, we predicted that higher localized microtubule (MT) depolymerization rates could generate the shorter spindles observed in egg extracts of X. tropicalis compared to X. laevis. We found that katanin-dependent MT severing was increased in X. tropicalis, which, unlike X. laevis, lacks an inhibitory phosphorylation site in the katanin p60 catalytic subunit. Katanin inhibition lengthened spindles in both species. In X. tropicalis, k-fiber MT bundles that connect to chromosomes at their kinetochores extended through spindle poles, disrupting them. In both X. tropicalis extracts and the spindle simulation, a balance between k-fiber number and MT depolymerization is required to maintain spindle morphology. Thus, mechanisms have evolved in different species to scale spindle size and coordinate regulation of multiple MT populations in order to generate a robust steady-state structure. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Accurate chromosome segregation depends on the establishment of correct-amphitelic-kinetochore orientation. Merotelic kinetochore orientation is an error that occurs when a single kinetochore attaches to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles, a condition that hinders segregation of the kinetochore to a spindle pole in anaphase. To avoid chromosome missegregation resulting from merotelic kinetochore orientation, cells have developed mechanisms to prevent or correct merotelic attachment. A protein called Pcs1 has been implicated in preventing merotelic attachment in mitosis and meiosis II in the fission yeast S. pombe. Results: We report that Pcs1 forms a complex with a protein called Mde4. Both Pcs1 and Mde4 localize to the central core of centromeres. Deletion of mde4+, like that of pcs1+, causes the appearance of lagging chromosomes during the anaphases of mitotic and meiosis II cells. We provide evidence that the kinetochores of lagging chromosomes in both pcs1 and mde4 mutant cells are merotelically attached. In addition, we find that lagging chromosomes in cells with defective centromeric heterochromatin also display features consistent with merotelic attachment. Conclusions: We suggest that the Pcs1/Mde4 complex is the fission yeast counterpart of the budding yeast monopolin subcomplex Csm1/Lrs4, which promotes the segregation of sister kinetochores to the same pole during meiosis I. We propose that the Pcs1/Mde4 complex acts in the central kinetochore domain to clamp microtubule binding sites together, the centromeric heterochromatin coating the flanking domains provides rigidity, and both systems contribute to the prevention of merotelic attachment. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The organization and number of microtubules (MTs) in a cell depend on the proper regulation of MT nucleation. Currently, the mechanism of nucleation is the most poorly understood aspect of MT dynamics. XMAP215/chTOG/Alp14/Stu2 proteins are MT polymerases that stimulate MT polymerization at MT plus ends by binding and releasing tubulin dimers. Although these proteins also localize to MT organizing centers and have nucleating activity in vitro, it is not yet clear whether these proteins participate in MT nucleation in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the XMAP215 ortholog Alp14 is critical for efficient MT nucleation in vivo. In multiple assays, loss of Alp14 function led to reduced nucleation rate and numbers of interphase MT bundles. Conversely, activation of Alp14 led to increased nucleation frequency. Alp14 associated with Mto1 and $\gamma$-tubulin complex components, and artificially targeting Alp14 to the $\gamma$-tubulin ring complexes ($\gamma$-TuRCs) stimulated nucleation. In imaging individual nucleation events, we found that Alp14 transiently associated with a $\gamma$-tubulin particle shortly before the appearance of a new MT. The transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC) ortholog Alp7 mediated the localization of Alp14 at nucleation sites but not plus ends, and was required for efficient nucleation but not for MT polymerization. Our findings provide the strongest evidence to date that Alp14 serves as a critical MT nucleation factor in vivo. We suggest a model in which Alp14 associates with the $\gamma$-tubulin complex in an Alp7-dependent manner to facilitate the assembly or stabilization of the nascent MT. Microtubules are dynamic polymers that help to organize cellular contents and divide the cell. New microtubules arise by a process of nucleation, in which tubulin subunits are stitched together to begin forming a hollow tube. Flor-Parra et al. identify XMAP215/Alp14 as a nucleation factor that facilitates the assembly of the microtubule.},

Alp7 accumulates in the nucleus only during mitosis, although its underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we investigate the behaviour of Alp7 and its binding partner, Alp14/TOG, throughout the cell cycle. Interestingly, Alp7 enters the nucleus during interphase but is subsequently exported to the cytoplasm by the Exportin-dependent nuclear export machinery. The continuous nuclear export of Alp7 during interphase is essential for maintaining the array-like cytoplasmic microtubule structure. The mitosis-specific nuclear accumulation of Alp7 seems to be under the control of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). These results indicate that the spatiotemporal regulation of microtubule formation is established by the Alp7/TACC-Alp14/TOG complex through the coordinated interplay of Ran and CDK.},

Bim1p forms a stable complex with Ipl1p and is phosphorylated on a cluster of six Ser residues in the flexible linker connecting the calponin homology (CH) and EB1 domains. Using reconstitution of plus end tracking in vitro and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that dimerization of Bim1p and the presence of the linker domain are both required for efficient tip tracking and that linker phosphorylation removes Bim1p from static and dynamic MTs. Bim1 phosphorylation occurs during anaphase in vivo, and it is required for normal spindle elongation kinetics and an efficient disassembly of the spindle midzone. Our results define a mechanism for the use and regulation of CH domains in an EB1 protein. {\textcopyright} 2009 Zimniak et al.},

In addition to this MT shortening activity, kinesin 8s are motors that show plus-end directed motility on MTs. Here we describe a simple model that incorporates directional motion and destabilization of the MT plus-end by kinesin 8. Our model quantitatively reproduces the key features of length-versus-time traces for stabilized MTs in the presence of purified kinesin 8, including length-dependent depolymerization. Comparison of model predictions with experiments suggests that kinesin 8 depolymerizes processively, i.e., one motor can remove multiple tubulin dimers from a stabilized MT. Fluctuations in MT length as a function of time are related to depolymerization processivity. We have also determined the parameter regime in which the rate of MT depolymerization is length dependent: length-dependent depolymerization occurs only when MTs are sufficiently short; this crossover is sensitive to the bulk motor concentration. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Molecular motor proteins fulfill the critical function of transporting organelles and other building blocks along the biopolymer network of the cell's cytoskeleton, but crowding effects are believed to crucially affect this motor-driven transport due to motor interactions. Physical transport models, like the paradigmatic, totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP), have been used to predict these crowding effects based on simple exclusion interactions, but verifying them in experiments remains challenging. Here, we introduce a correlation imaging technique to precisely measure the motor density, velocity, and run length along filaments under crowding conditions, enabling us to elucidate the physical nature of crowding and test TASEP model predictions. Using the kinesin motor proteins kinesin-1 and OSM-3, we identify crowding effects in qualitative agreement with TASEP predictions, and we achieve excellent quantitative agreement by extending the model with motor-specific interaction ranges and crowding-dependent detachment probabilities. These results confirm the applicability of basic nonequilibrium models to the intracellular transport and highlight motor-specific strategies to deal with crowding.},

abstract = {The metaphase-to-anaphase transition is one of the most dramatic and highly regulated steps in cell division. At anaphase onset the protease separase dissolves sister chromatid cohesion. Simultaneously, the mitotic spindle elongates as interpolar microtubules (iMTs) slide apart at the spindle midzone, ensuring chromosome segregation. However, it remains unclear how spindle elongation is coordinated with cell cycle progression. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation of the midzone organizer Ase1 controls localization and function of Cin8, a kinesin-5 that slides iMTs relative to each other. Phosphorylation of Ase1 by Cdk1 (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibits Cin8 binding to iMTs, preventing bending and collapse of the metaphase spindle. In anaphase Ase1 dephosphorylation by the separase-activated phosphatase Cdc14 is necessary and sufficient for Cin8 recruitment to the midzone, where it drives spindle elongation. Our results reveal that sliding forces at the midzone are activated by separase and explain how spindle elongation is triggered with anaphase entry. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Metaphase describes a phase of mitosis where chromosomes are attached and oriented on the bipolar spindle for subsequent segregation at anaphase. In diverse cell types, the metaphase spindle is maintained at characteristic constant length [1–3]. Metaphase spindle length is proposed to be regulated by a balance of pushing and pulling forces generated by distinct sets of spindle microtubules (MTs) and their interactions with motors and MT-associated proteins (MAPs). Spindle length is further proposed to be important for chromosome segregation fidelity, as cells with shorter- or longer-than-normal metaphase spindles, generated through deletion or inhibition of individual mitotic motors or MAPs, showed chromosome segregation defects. To test the force-balance model of spindle length control and its effect on chromosome segregation, we applied fast microfluidic temperature control with live-cell imaging to monitor the effect of deleting or switching off different combinations of antagonistic force contributors in the fission yeast metaphase spindle. We show that the spindle midzone proteins kinesin-5 cut7p and MT bundler ase1p contribute to outward-pushing forces and that the spindle kinetochore proteins kinesin-8 klp5/6p and dam1p contribute to inward-pulling forces. Removing these proteins individually led to aberrant metaphase spindle length and chromosome segregation defects. Removing these proteins in antagonistic combination rescued the defective spindle length and in some combinations also partially rescued chromosome segregation defects.},

abstract = {High-fidelity chromosome segregation relies on proper microtubule regulation. Kinesin-8 has been shown to destabilise microtubules to reduce metaphase spindle length and chromosome movements in multiple species. XMAP215/chTOG polymerases catalyse microtubule growth for spindle assembly, elongation and kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Understanding of their biochemical activity has advanced, but little work directly addresses the functionality and interplay of these conserved factors. We utilised the synthetic lethality of fission yeast kinesin-8 (Klp5-Klp6) and XMAP215/chTOG (Dis1) to study their individual and overlapping roles. We found that the non-motor kinesin-8 tailbox is essential for mitotic function; mutation compromises plus-end-directed processivity. Klp5-Klp6 induces catastrophes to control microtubule length and, surprisingly, Dis1 collaborates with kinesin-8 to slow spindle elongation. Together, they enforce a maximum spindle length for a viable metaphase-anaphase transition and limit elongation during anaphase A to prevent lagging chromatids. Our work provides mechanistic insight into how kinesin-8 negatively regulates microtubules and how this functionally overlaps with Dis1 and highlights the importance of spindle length control in mitosis.},
annote = {My understanding of this is:

1. Dis1 alone does not change much for the length of the spindle, but as kown already, it causes a delay in anaphase onset.

2. If, on top of that you delete kin5/kin6, which are recruited to the kinetochore.

3. When you delete one or the other you have phenotype, but you always go into anaphase B, and proceed with spindle elongation.

4. However, when you delete both, in some cases anaphase onset is so delayed, and due to the non-stop growth caused by kinesin-8 deletion you end up elongating as much as you would in anaphase.

5. The nucleus stays on one side, consistent with the chromosome thing.},

abstract = {XMAP215/Dis1 proteins are conserved tubulin-binding TOG-domain proteins that regulate microtubule (MT) plus-end dynamics. Here we show that Alp14, a XMAP215 orthologue in fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, has properties of a MT polymerase. In vivo, Alp14 localizes to growing MT plus ends in a manner independent of Mal3 (EB1). alp14-null mutants display short interphase MTs with twofold slower assembly rate and frequent pauses. Alp14 is a homodimer that binds a single tubulin dimer. In vitro, purified Alp14 molecules track growing MT plus ends and accelerate MT assembly threefold. TOG-domain mutants demonstrate that tubulin binding is critical for function and plus end localization. Overexpression of Alp14 or only its TOG domains causes complete MT loss in vivo, and high Alp14 concentration inhibits MT assembly in vitro. These inhibitory effects may arise from Alp14 sequestration of tubulin and effects on the MT. Our studies suggest that Alp14 regulates the polymerization state of tubulin by cycling between a tubulin dimer-bound cytoplasmic state and a MT polymerase state that promotes rapid MT assembly. {\textcopyright} 2012 Al-Bassam et al.},

The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe presents a good model for understanding microtubule organization. We identify fission yeast ase1p, a member of the conserved ASE1/PRC1/MAP65 family of microtubule bundling proteins, which functions in organizing the spindle midzone during mitosis. Using fluorescence live cell imaging, we show that ase1p localizes to sites of microtubule overlaps associated with microtubule organizing centers at both interphase and mitosis. ase1Delta mutants fail to form overlapping antiparallel microtubule bundles, leading to interphase nuclear positioning defects, and premature mitotic spindle collapse. FRAP analysis revealed that interphase ase1p at overlapping microtubule minus ends is highly dynamic. In contrast, mitotic ase1p at microtubule plus ends at the spindle midzone is more stable. We propose that ase1p functions to organize microtubules into overlapping antiparallel bundles both in interphase and mitosis and that ase1p may be differentially regulated through the cell cycle.},

abstract = {Bacillus anthracis secretes two bipartite toxins thought to be involved in anthrax pathogenesis and resulting death of the host. The current model for intoxication is that protective antigen (PA) toxin subunits bind a single group of cell-surface anthrax toxin receptors (ATRs), encoded by the tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) gene. The ATR/TEM8-PA interaction is mediated by the receptor's extracellular domain related to von Willebrand factor type A or integrin inserted domains (VWA/I domains). A metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) located within this domain of the ATR/TEM8 protein chelates a divalent cation critical for PA binding. In this report, we identify a second PA receptor encoded by capillary morphogenesis gene 2 (CMG2), which has 60{\%} amino acid identity to ATR/TEM8 within the VWA/I domain, as well as a conserved MIDAS motif. A recombinant CMG2 protein bound PA and mediated toxin internalization when expressed on receptor-deficient cells. Binding between the CMG2 VWA/I domain and PA was shown to be direct and metal-dependent, although the cation specificity of this interaction is different than that observed with ATR/TEM8. Northern blot analysis revealed that CMG2 is widely expressed in human tissues, indicating that this receptor is likely to be relevant for disease pathogenesis. Finally, a soluble version of the CMG2 VWA/I domain inhibited intoxication of cells expressing endogenous toxin receptors when it was added to PA at a 3:1 ratio. These studies distinguish CMG2 as a second anthrax toxin receptor and identify a potent antitoxin that may prove useful for the treatment of anthrax.},

abstract = {Microtubules are essential intracellular structures involved in several cellular phenomena, including polarity establishment and chromosome segregation. Because the nuclear envelope persists during mitosis (closed mitosis) in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), cytoplasmic microtubules must be reorganized into the spindle in the compartmentalized nucleus on mitotic entry. An ideal mechanism might be to take advantage of an evolutionarily conserved microtubule formation system that uses the Ran-GTPase nuclear transport machinery, but no targets of Ran for spindle formation have been identified in yeast. Here we show that a microtubule-associated protein, Alp7, which forms a complex with Alp14, is a target of Ran in yeast for spindle formation. The Ran-deficient pim1 mutant (pim1-F201S) failed to show mitosis-specific nuclear accumulation of Alp7. Moreover, this mutant exhibited compromised spindle formation and early mitotic delay. Importantly, these defects were suppressed by Alp7 that was artificially targeted to the nucleus by a Ran-independent and importin-$\alpha$-mediated system. Thus, Ran targets Alp7-Alp14 to achieve nuclear spindle formation, and might differentiate its targets depending on whether the organism undergoes closed or open mitosis. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

Kinesin-5 may function only by binding, cross-linking, and sliding adjacent spindle microtubules (MTs), or, alternatively, it may bind to a stable "spindle matrix" to generate mitotic movements. We created transgenic Drosophila melanogaster expressing fluorescent kinesin-5, KLP61F-GFP, in a klp61f mutant background, where it rescues mitosis and viability. KLP61F-GFP localizes to interpolar MT bundles, half spindles, and asters, and is enriched around spindle poles. In fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments, KLP61F-GFP displays dynamic mobility similar to tubulin, which is inconsistent with a substantial static pool of kinesin-5. The data conform to a reaction-diffusion model in which most KLP61F is bound to spindle MTs, with the remainder diffusing freely. KLP61F appears to transiently bind MTs, moving short distances along them before detaching. Thus, kinesin-5 motors can function by cross-linking and sliding adjacent spindle MTs without the need for a static spindle matrix.},

Mitotic cells lacking both TOGp and MCAK formed bipolar and monopolar spindles, indicating that TOGp and MCAK contribute to spindle bipolarity, without major effects on MT stability. TOGp localized to centrosomes in the absence of MTs and depletion of TOGp resulted in centrosome fragmentation. TOGp depletion also disrupted MT minus-end focus at the spindle poles, detected by localizations of NuMA and the p150 component of dynactin.

Bik1 forms a complex with the kinesin Kip2. Fluorescently labeled Bik1 and Kip2 comigrate along individual microtubules. Bik1 exists in distinct intracellular pools: a stable pool at the spindle pole body that is depleted during cell cycle progression, a soluble pool from which Bik1 can be recruited during microtubule initiation, and a dynamic plus end pool maintained by Kip2. Kip2 stabilizes microtubules by targeting Bik1 to the plus end and Kip2 levels are controlled during the cell cycle. As with Bik1, the targeting of dynein to the microtubule plus end requires Kip2.

abstract = {Although the large majority of solid tumors show a combination of mitotic spindle defects and chromosomal instability, little is known about the mechanisms that govern the initial steps in tumorigenesis. The recent report of spindle-induced DNA damage provides evidence for a single mechanism responsible for the most prominent genetic defects in chromosomal instability. Spindle-induced DNA damage is brought about by uncorrected merotelic attachments, which cause kinetochore distortion, chromosome breakage at the centromere, and possible activation of DNA damage repair pathways. Although merotelic attachments are common early in mitosis, some escape detection by the kinetochore pathway. As a consequence, a proportion of merotelic attachments gives rise to chromosome breakage in normal cells and in carcinomas. An intrinsic chromosome segregation defect might thus form the basis of tumor initiation.

abstract = {Mitotic spindle orientation can influence tissue organization and vice versa. Cells orient their spindles by rotating them parallel or perpendicular to the cell--and hence the tissue--axis. Spindle orientation in turn controls the placement of daughter cells within a tissue, influencing tissue morphology. Recent findings implicating tumor suppressor proteins in spindle orientation bring to the forefront a connection between spindle misorientation and cancer. In this Commentary, we focus on the role of three major human tumor suppressors--adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), E-cadherin and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)--in spindle orientation. We discuss how, in addition to their better-known functions, these proteins affect microtubule stability and cell polarity, and how their loss of function causes spindles to become misoriented. We also consider how other cancer-associated features, such as oncogene mutations, centrosome amplification and the tumor microenvironment, might influence spindle orientation. Finally, we speculate on the role of spindle misorientation in cancer development and progression. We conclude that spindle misorientation alone is unlikely to be tumorigenic, but it has the potential to synergize with cancer-associated changes to facilitate genomic instability, tissue disorganization, metastasis and expansion of cancer stem cell compartments.},

abstract = {Mechanical forces produced by motor proteins and microtubule dynamics within the mitotic spindle are crucial for the movement of chromosomes and their segregation into the emerging daughter cells. In addition to linear forces, rotational forces are present in the spindle, reflected in the left-handed twisted shapes of microtubule bundles that make the spindle chiral. However, the molecular origins of spindle chirality are unknown. Here we show that spindles are most twisted at the beginning of anaphase, and reveal multiple molecular players involved in spindle chirality. Inhibition of Eg5/kinesin-5 in a non-cancer cell line abolished spindle twist and depletion of Kif18A/kinesin-8 resulted in a right-handed twist, implying that these motors regulate twist likely by rotating the microtubules around one another within the antiparallel overlaps of bridging fibers. Depletion of the crosslinker PRC1 resulted in a right-handed twist, indicating that PRC1 may contribute to the twist by constraining free rotation of microtubules. Overexpression of PRC1 abolished twist, possibly due to increased torsional rigidity of the bundles. Depletion of augmin led to a right-handed twist, suggesting that twist depends on the geometry of microtubule nucleation. Round spindles were more twisted than elongated ones, a notion that we directly tested by compressing the spindle along its axis, which resulted in stronger left-handed twist, indicating a correlation between bending moments and twist. We conclude that spindle twist is controlled by multiple molecular mechanisms acting at different locations within the spindle as well as forces, and propose a potential physiological role of twist in promoting passive mechanical response of the spindle to forces during metaphase.},

abstract = {The spindle midzone-composed of antiparallel microtubules, microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), and motors-is the structure responsible for microtubule organization and sliding during anaphase B. In general, MAPs and motors stabilize the midzone and motors produce sliding. We show that fission yeast kinesin-6 motor klp9p binds to the microtubule antiparallel bundler ase1p at the midzone at anaphase B onset. This interaction depends upon the phosphorylation states of klp9p and ase1p. The cyclin-dependent kinase cdc2p phosphorylates and its antagonist phosphatase clp1p dephosphorylates klp9p and ase1p to control the position and timing of klp9p-ase1p interaction. Failure of klp9p-ase1p binding leads to decreased spindle elongation velocity. The ase1p-mediated recruitment of klp9p to the midzone accelerates pole separation, as suggested by computer simulation. Our findings indicate that a phosphorylation switch controls the spatial-temporal interactions of motors and MAPs for proper anaphase B, and suggest a mechanism whereby a specific motor-MAP conformation enables efficient microtubule sliding. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We now report the cloning and further characterization of one such mutant, gulliver(m208) (gul(m208)). The notochord defect in gul(m208) mutants is exacerbated under conditions of copper depletion or lysyl oxidase cuproenzyme inhibition that are without a notochord effect on wild-type embryos. The gul(m208) phenotype results from a missense mutation in the gene encoding Col8a1, a lysyl oxidase substrate, and morpholino knockdown of col8a1 recapitulates the notochord distortion observed in gul(m208) mutants. Of interest, the amino acid mutated in gul(m208) Col8a1 is highly conserved, and the equivalent substitution in a closely related human protein, COL10A1, causes Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia. Taken together, the data identify a new protein essential for notochord morphogenesis, extend our understanding of gene-nutrient interactions in early development, and suggest that human mutations in COL8A1 may cause structural birth defects.},

However, several recent reports from different organisms have shed new light on this issue. A key player in microtubule-kinetochore interaction is the conserved Ndc80 outer kinetochore complex. In both yeast and human cells in particular, a ubiquitous internal 'loop' found in the Ndc80 molecule interrupting its C-terminal coiled-coil domain plays critical roles in protein-protein interaction, by recruiting microtubule-binding proteins to ensure proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment. In this commentary, we summarise the recent progress made and discuss the evolutionary significance of this loop's role in microtubule dynamics at the kinetochore for accurate chromosome segregation.},

abstract = {Sphingolipids are bio-active metabolites that show structural diversity among eukaryotes. They are essential for growth of all eukaryotic cells but when produced in an uncontrolled manner can lead to cell death and pathologies including auto-immune reactions, cancer, diabetes and neurodegeneration. Caenorhabditis elegans is an important genetic model organism both to find new drug-targets against parasitic nematodes and to study the conserved roles of sphingolipids in animals like their essential functions in very basic cellular processes ranging from maintenance of cell polarity and mitochondrial repair to growth and survival. C. elegans produces sphingoid bases which are structurally distinct from those of other animals as both iso-and anteiso-branched species have been reported. Using metabolic labeling we show that most worm sphingoid bases are iso-branched. We have synthesized the nematode-specific C17 iso-branched sphinganine and its 1-deoxy analogue and could show that both the iso-branch and the 1-hydroxyl group are essential to form functional nematode sphingolipids which are needed to maintain intestinal function. The organism specificity was examined by complementation experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells lacking sphingoid base synthesis. We found that iso-branched sphingoid base did not support growth of mutant cells and was toxic to wild type yeast. 1-Deoxy sphingolipids have been linked to the hereditary disease HSAN1A and other metabolic disorders including diabetes. We found that in C. elegans the 1-deoxy analogue cannot rescue the intestinal phenotype caused by sphingoid base depletion. In fact, in wild-type animals with normal sphingoid base biosynthesis, exogenous 1-deoxy analogue had a disruptive effect on apical cytoskeletal organization of intestinal cells indicating that atypical bases can interfere with normal sphingolipid function.},

abstract = {Most kinesin motors move in only one direction along microtubules. Members of the kinesin-5 subfamily were initially described as unidirectional plus-end-directed motors and shown to produce piconewton forces. However, some fungal kinesin-5 motors are bidirectional. The force production of a bidirectional kinesin-5 has not yet been measured. Therefore, it remains unknown whether the mechanism of the unconventional minus-end-directed motility differs fundamentally from that of plus-end-directed stepping. Using force spectroscopy, we have measured here the forces that ensembles of purified budding yeast kinesin-5 Cin8 produce in microtubule gliding assays in both plus- and minus-end direction. Correlation analysis of pause forces demonstrated that individual Cin8 molecules produce additive forces in both directions of movement. In ensembles, Cin8 motors were able to produce single-motor forces up to a magnitude of ∼1.5 pN. Hence, these properties appear to be conserved within the kinesin-5 subfamily. Force production was largely independent of the directionality of movement, indicating similarities between the motility mechanisms for both directions. These results provide constraints for the development of models for the bidirectional motility mechanism of fission yeast kinesin-5 and provide insight into the function of this mitotic motor.},

abstract = {Animal cell shape is controlled primarily by the actomyosin cortex, a thin cytoskeletal network that lies directly beneath the plasma membrane. The cortex regulates cell morphology by controlling cellular mechanical properties, which are determined by network structure and geometry. In particular, cortex thickness is expected to influence cell mechanics. However, cortex thickness is near the resolution limit of the light microscope, making studies relating cortex thickness and cell shape challenging. To overcome this, we developed an assay to measure cortex thickness in live cells, combining confocal imaging and subresolution image analysis. We labeled the actin cortex and plasma membrane with chromatically different fluorophores and measured the distance between the resulting intensity peaks. Using a theoretical description of cortex geometry and microscopic imaging, we extracted an average cortex thickness of ∼190 nm in mitotic HeLa cells and tested the validity of our assay using cell images generated in silico. We found that thickness increased after experimental treatments preventing F-actin disassembly. Finally, we monitored physiological changes in cortex thickness in real-time during actin cortex regrowth in cellular blebs. Our investigation paves the way to understanding how molecular processes modulate cortex structure, which in turn drives cell morphogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Integrin recognition of fibronectin is required for normal gastrulation including the mediolateral cell intercalation behaviors that drive convergent extension and the elongation of the frog dorsal axis; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved are unclear.

RESULTS: We report that depletion of fibronectin with antisense morpholinos blocks both convergent extension and mediolateral protrusive behaviors in explant preparations. Both chronic depletion of fibronectin and acute disruptions of integrin alpha5beta1 binding to fibronectin increases the frequency and randomizes the orientation of polarized cellular protrusions, suggesting that integrin-fibronectin interactions normally repress frequent random protrusions in favor of fewer mediolaterally oriented ones. In the absence of integrin alpha5beta1 binding to fibronectin, convergence movements still occur but result in convergent thickening instead of convergent extension.

CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a role for integrin signaling in regulating the protrusive activity that drives axial extension. We hypothesize that the planar spatial arrangement of the fibrillar fibronectin matrix, which delineates tissue compartments within the embryo, is critical for promoting productive oriented protrusions in intercalating cells.},

abstract = {The widespread reorganization of cellular architecture in mitosis is achieved through extensive protein phosphorylation, driven by the coordinated activation of a mitotic kinase network and repression of counteracting phosphatases. Phosphatase activity must subsequently be restored to promote mitotic exit. Although Cdc14 phosphatase drives this reversal in budding yeast, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activities have each been independently linked to mitotic exit control in other eukaryotes1-6. Here we describe a mitotic phosphatase relay inwhichPP1 reactivation is required for the reactivation of both PP2A-B55 and PP2AB56 to coordinate mitotic progression and exit in fission yeast. The staged recruitment of PP1 (the Dis2 isoform) to the regulatory subunits of thePP2A-B55 andPP2A-B56 (B55 also knownas Pab1; B56 also known as Par1) holoenzymes sequentially activates each phosphatase. The pathway is blocked in early mitosis because the Cdk1- cyclin B kinase (Cdk1 also known as Cdc2) inhibits PP1 activity, but declining cyclinBlevels later inmitosis permitPP1to auto-reactivate1,7-10. PP1 first reactivates PP2A-B55; this enables PP2A-B55 in turn to promote the reactivation ofPP2A-B56 by dephosphorylating a PP1- docking site inPP2A-B56, thereby promoting the recruitment of PP1. PP1 recruitment to human, mitotic PP2A-B56 holoenzymes and the sequences of these conserved PP1-docking motifs11,12 suggest that PP1 regulates PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 activities in a variety of signalling contexts throughout eukaryotes.},

Each tubulin monomer binds a guanine nucleotide, which is non-exchangeable when it is bound in the a subunit, or N site, and exchangeable when bound in the $\beta$ subunit, or E site. The $\alpha$- and $\beta$-tubulins share 40{\%} amino-acid sequence identity, both exist in several isotype forms, and both undergo a variety of posttranslational modification. Limited sequence homology has been found with the proteins FtsZ2 and Misato3 which are involved in cell division in bacteria and Drosophila, respectively. Here we present an atomic model of the $\alpha$$\beta$ tubulin dimer fitted to a 3.7-{\AA} density map obtained by electron crystallography of zinc induced tubulin sheets. The structures of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-tubulin are basically identical: each monomer is formed by a core of two $\beta$-sheets surrounded by $\alpha$-helices. The monomer structure is very compact, but can be divided into three functional domains: the amino-terminal domain containing the nucleotide-binding region, an intermediate domain containing the Taxol- binding site and the carboxy-terminal domain, which probably constitutes the binding surface for motor proteins.},

Quantitative mechanistic understanding of how spindle assembly can be both fast and accurate is lacking. Specifically, it is unclear how, if at all, chromosome movements and combining the centrosomal and chromosomal pathways affect the assembly speed and accuracy. We used computer simulations and high-resolution microscopy to test plausible pathways of spindle assembly in realistic geometry. Our results suggest that an optimal combination of centrosomal and chromosomal pathways, spatially biased microtubule growth, and chromosome movements and rotations is needed to complete prometaphase in 10-20 min while keeping erroneous merotelic attachmentsdownto a few percent. The simulations also provide kinetic constraints for alternative error correction mechanisms, shed light on the dual role of chromosome arm volume, and compare well with experimental data for bipolar and multipolar HT-29 colorectal cancer cells.},

abstract = {Motor and non-motor crosslinking proteins play critical roles in determining the size and stability of microtubule-based architectures. Currently, we have a limited understanding of how geometrical properties of microtubule arrays, in turn, regulate the output of crosslinking proteins. Here we investigate this problem in the context of microtubule sliding by two interacting proteins: the non-motor crosslinker PRC1 and the kinesin Kif4A. The collective activity of PRC1 and Kif4A also results in their accumulation at microtubule plus-ends (‘end-tag'). Sliding stalls when the end-tags on antiparallel microtubules collide, forming a stable overlap. Interestingly, we find that structural properties of the initial array regulate microtubule organization by PRC1-Kif4A. First, sliding velocity scales with initial microtubule-overlap length. Second, the width of the final overlap scales with microtubule lengths. Our analyses reveal how micron-scale geometrical features of antiparallel microtubules can regulate the activity of nanometer-sized proteins to define the structure and mechanics of microtubule-based architectures.},

abstract = {A quarter of all solid tumors harbor KRAS oncogenes. Yet, no selective drugs have been approved to treat these malignancies. Genetic interrogation of the MAPK pathway revealed that systemic ablation of MEK or ERK kinases in adult mice prevent tumor development but are unacceptably toxic. Here, we demonstrate that ablation of c-RAF expression in advanced tumors driven by KrasG12V/Trp53 mutations leads to significant tumor regression with no detectable appearance of resistance mechanisms. Tumor regression results from massive apoptosis. Importantly, systemic abrogation of c-RAF expression does not inhibit canonical MAPK signaling, hence, resulting in limited toxicities. These results are of significant relevance for the design of therapeutic strategies to treat K-RAS mutant cancers. Sanclemente et al. generate oncogenic Kras mice that allow inducible deletion of Raf1, encoding c-RAF, and/or Braf in established KrasG12V or KrasG12V;Trp53−/− lung tumors. They show that systemic c-RAF ablation has limited toxicity and leads to significant tumor regression without having an impact on MAPK activity.},

abstract = {Actomyosin contractility plays a central role in a wide range of cellular processes, including the establishment of cell polarity, cell migration, tissue integrity, and morphogenesis during development. The contractile response is variable and depends on actomyosin network architecture and biochemical composition. To determine how this coupling regulates actomyosin-driven contraction, we used a micropatterning method that enables the spatial control of actin assembly. We generated a variety of actin templates and measured how defined actin structures respond to myosin-induced forces. We found that the same actin filament crosslinkers either enhance or inhibit the contractility of a network, depending on the organization of actin within the network. Numerical simulations unified the roles of actin filament branching and crosslinking during actomyosin contraction. Specifically, we introduce the concept of "network connectivity" and show that the contractions of distinct actin architectures are described by the same master curve when considering their degree of connectivity. This makes it possible to predict the dynamic response of defined actin structures to transient changes in connectivity. We propose that, depending on the connectivity and the architecture, network contraction is dominated by either sarcomeric-like or buckling mechanisms. More generally, this study reveals how actin network contractility depends on its architecture under a defined set of biochemical conditions.},

Deletion analysis identified a coiled-coil domain in teal p essential for its retention at cell ends, and demonstrated that teal p exerts different functions dependent on its location. On the tips of microtubules, tea1p prevents the curling of microtubules around the cell ends, whereas it is required for maintaining linear cell growth and for retention of polarity factors such as the Dyrk kinase pom1p, the CLIP170-like tip1p, and tea2p at the cell ends. We propose that tea1p has roles in organizing the microtubule cytoskeleton on the tips of microtubules, and in the retention of factors at the cell ends necessary for the cell to grow in a straight line.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Regulation of size and growth is a fundamental problem in biology. A prominent example is the formation of the mitotic spindle, where protein concentration gradients around chromosomes are thought to regulate spindle growth by controlling microtubule nucleation. Previous evidence suggests that microtubules nucleate throughout the spindle structure. However, the mechanisms underlying microtubule nucleation and its spatial regulation are still unclear. Here, we developed an assay based on laser ablation to directly probe microtubule nucleation events in Xenopus laevis egg extracts. Combining this method with theory and quantitative microscopy, we show that the size of a spindle is controlled by autocatalytic growth of microtubules, driven by microtubule-stimulated microtubule nucleation. The autocatalytic activity of this nucleation system is spatially regulated by the limiting amounts of active microtubule nucleators, which decrease with distance from the chromosomes. This mechanism provides an upper limit to spindle size even when resources are not limiting.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This could be either because of something that diffuses from the centrosome, or something that depends on microtubule themselves, to test this they use MCAK inhibition, which decreases catastrophy, and results in bigger monopolars, the decay of minus end positions becomes longer, wihch means that more microtubules nucleate more microtubules. They do something similar and put some physical obstacle , and they see that where microtubules do not reach, there is no nucleation.

A fundamental point is that for the spindle size to finite, if nucleation is autocatalitic, the total amount of nucleators has to be limited, in other words, the microtubules on the outside have to nucleate {\textless}1 mt on average.

Conclusion is that the size of the monopolar is given by a system in which the number of nucleators is limited, activate in the center, and distribute along microtubules to promote nucleation.

abstract = {The hand-over-hand stepping mechanism of kinesin at low loads is inadequately understood because the number of molecular steps taken per encounter with the microtubule [1–4] is difficult to measure: optical traps do not register steps at zero load [3, 5], while evanescent wave microscopy of single molecules of GFP-kinesin suffers from premature photobleaching [2, 6]. Obtaining low-load data is important because it can efficiently distinguish between alternative proposed mechanisms for molecular walking [7–10]. We report a novel experiment that records the missing data. We fused kinesin to gelsolin [11], creating a construct that severs and caps rhodamine-phalloidin actin filaments, setting exactly one kinesin molecule on one end of each fluorescent actin filament. Single kinesin molecules labeled in this way can be tracked easily and definitively using a standard epifluorescence microscope. We use the new system to show that, contrary to a recent report [9], kinesin run length at low load is independent of ATP concentration in the $\mu$M to mM range of ATP concentration. Adding competitor ADP in the presence of saturating ATP decreases both velocity and run length. Based on these data, we propose a simplified model for the mechanism of processive stepping.},

abstract = {Hyaline fibromatosis syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in ANTXR2, a gene involved in extracellular matrix homeostasis. Sixty percent of patients carry frameshift mutations at a mutational hotspot in exon 13. We show in patient cells that these mutations lead to low ANTXR2 mRNA and undetectable protein levels. Ectopic expression of the proteins encoded by the mutated genes reveals that a two base insertion leads to the synthesis of a protein that is rapidly targeted to the ER-associated degradation pathway due to the modified structure of the cytosolic tail, which instead of being hydrophilic and highly disordered as in wild type ANTXR2, is folded and exposes hydrophobic patches. In contrast, one base insertion leads to a truncated protein that properly localizes to the plasma membrane and retains partial function. We next show that targeting the nonsense mediated mRNA decay pathway in patient cells leads to a rescue of ANTXR2 protein in patients carrying one base insertion but not in those carrying two base insertions. This study highlights the importance of in-depth analysis of the molecular consequences of specific patient mutations, which even when they occur at the same site can have drastically different consequences.},

It is very amenable to genetic analysis and its predominantly haploid life cycle has allowed the isolation of recessive temperature-sensitive mutants unable to complete the cell cycle. Classical genetic analysis of these mutants has been used to identify over 40 gene functions that are required for cell cycle progress in S. pombe. Many of these genes have now been cloned and sequenced and in some cases the encoded gene products has been identified [1-3].

Mitosis has been studied in a wide variety of eukaryotes for more than a century4, but how the double membrane of the nuclear envelope is split into two at the end of a closed mitosis without compromising the impermeability of the nuclear compartment remains unknown5. Here, using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (a classical model for closed mitosis5), genetics, live-cell imaging and electron tomography, we show that nuclear fission is achieved via local disassembly of nuclear pores within the narrow bridge that links segregating daughter nuclei. In doing so, we identify the protein Les1, which is localized to the inner nuclear envelope and restricts the process of local nuclear envelope breakdown to the bridge midzone to prevent the leakage of material from daughter nuclei. The mechanism of local nuclear envelope breakdown in a closed mitosis therefore closely mirrors nuclear envelope breakdown in open mitosis3, revealing an unexpectedly high conservation of nuclear remodelling mechanisms across diverse eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Anaphase B spindle elongation is characterized by the sliding apart of overlapping antiparallel interpolar (ip) microtubules (MTs) as the two opposite spindle poles separate, pulling along disjoined sister chromatids, thereby contributing to chromosome segregation and the propagation of all cellular life. The major biochemical “modules” that cooperate to mediate pole–pole separation include: (i) midzone pushing or (ii) braking by MT crosslinkers, such as kinesin-5 motors, which facilitate or restrict the outward sliding of antiparallel interpolar MTs (ipMTs); (iii) cortical pulling by disassembling astral MTs (aMTs) and/or dynein motors that pull aMTs outwards; (iv) ipMT plus end dynamics, notably net polymerization; and (v) ipMT minus end depolymerization manifest as poleward flux. The differential combination of these modules in different cell types produces diversity in the anaphase B mechanism. Combinations of antagonist modules can create a force balance that maintains the dynamic pre-anaphase B spindle at constant length. Tipping such a force balance at anaphase B onset can initiate and control the rate of spindle elongation. The activities of the basic motor filament components of the anaphase B machinery are controlled by a network of non-motor MT-associated proteins (MAPs), for example the key MT cross-linker, Ase1p/PRC1, and various cell-cycle kinases, phosphatases, and proteases. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms of anaphase B spindle elongation in eukaryotic cells and briefly mentions bacterial DNA segregation systems that operate by spindle elongation.},

This extremely asymmetric division enables the oocyte to retain sufficient storage material for the development of the embryo after fertilization. To divide asymmetrically, mammalian oocytes relocate the spindle from their center to the cortex. In all mammalian species analyzed so far, including human, mouse, cow, pig, and hamster, spindle relocation depends on filamentous actin (F-actin). However, even though spindle relocation is essential for fertility, the involved F-actin structures and the mechanism by which they relocate the spindle are unknown. Here we show in live mouse oocytes that spindle relocation requires a continuously reorganizing cytoplasmic actin network nucleated by Formin-2 (Fmn2). We found that the spindle poles were enriched in activated myosin and pulled on this network. Inhibition of myosin activation by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) stopped pulling and spindle relocation, indicating that myosin pulling creates the force that drives spindle movement. Based on these results, we propose the first mechanistic model for asymmetric spindle positioning in mammalian oocytes and validate five of its key predictions experimentally.},

abstract = {Anaphase chromatin bridges can lead to chromosome breakage if not properly resolved before completion of cytokinesis. The NoCut checkpoint, which depends on Aurora B at the spindle midzone, delays abscission in response to chromosome segregation defects in yeast and animal cells. How chromatin bridges are detected, and whether abscission inhibition prevents their damage, remain key unresolved questions. We find that bridges induced by DNA replication stress and by condensation or decatenation defects, but not dicentric chromosomes, delay abscission in a NoCut-dependent manner. Decatenation and condensation defects lead to spindle stabilization during cytokinesis, allowing bridge detection by Aurora B. NoCut does not prevent DNA damage following condensin or topoisomerase II inactivation; however, it protects anaphase bridges and promotes cellular viability after replication stress. Therefore, the molecular origin of chromatin bridges is critical for activation of NoCut, which plays a key role in the maintenance of genome stability after replicative stress.},

This mechanism delays ring contraction, to solve the errors.

This delay is supressed in Aurora B ts, or Ahc1 (noCut component). However, note that this also delays ring contraction. (Aurora B should ts also delay spindle disassembly)

IMPORTANT: this arrest does not depend on Rad9 like the mid-anaphase stop proposed before

Removing the spindle with nocodazole removes the arrest

abstract = {Background: Mitotic and meiotic spindles are assemblies of microtubules (MTs) that form during cell division to physically separate sister chromosomes. How the various components of spindles act together to establish and maintain the dynamic bipolar structure of spindles is not understood. Interactions between MTs and motors have been studied both experimentally and theoretically in many contexts, including the self-organization of arrays of MTs by motors and the competition between different classes of motors to move a single load. This work demonstrates how the interplay between two types of motors together with continual nucleation of MTs by chromosomes could organize the MTs into spindles. Results: We propose a slide-and-cluster model based on four known molecular activities: MT nucleation near chromosomes, the sliding of MTs by a plus-end-directed motor, the clustering of their minus ends by a minus-end-directed motor, and the loss of MTs by dynamic instability. Our model applies to overlapping, nonkinetochore MTs in anastral spindles, and perhaps also to interpolar MTs in astral spindles. We show mathematically that the slide-and-cluster mechanism robustly forms bipolar spindles with sharp poles and a stable steady-state length. This model accounts for several experimental observations that were difficult to explain with existing models. Three new predictions of the model were tested and verified in Xenopus egg extracts. Conclusions: We show that a simple two-motor model could create stable, bipolar spindles under a wide range of physical parameters. Our model is the first self-contained model for anastral spindle assembly and MT sliding (known as poleward flux). Our experimental results support the slide-and-cluster scenario; most significantly, we find that MT sliding slows near spindle poles, confirming the model's primary prediction. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we (i) propose a molecular mechanism in which the bipolar kinesin KLP61F persistently slides dynamically unstable ipMTs outward, the MT depolymerase KLP10A acts at the poles to convert ipMT sliding to flux, and the chromokinesin KLP3A inhibits the depolymerase to suppress flux, thereby coupling ipMT sliding to spindle elongation; (ii) used KLP3A inhibitors to interfere with the coupling process, which revealed an inverse linear relation between the rates of flux and elongation, supporting the proposed mechanism and demonstrating that the suppression of flux controls both the rate and onset of spindle elongation; and (iii) developed a mathematical model using force balance and rate equations to describe how motors sliding the highly dynamic ipMTs apart can drive spindle elongation at a steady rate determined by the extent of suppression of flux.},

abstract = {During cell division, different molecular motors act synergistically to rearrange microtubules. Minus end-directed motors are thought to have a dual role: focusing microtubule ends to poles and establishing together with plus end-directed motors a balance of force between antiparallel microtubules in the spindle. We study here the competing action of Xenopus laevis kinesin-14 and -5 in vitro in situations in which these motors with opposite directionality cross-link and slide microtubules. We find that full-length kinesin-14 can form microtubule asters without additional factors, whereas kinesin-5 does not, likely reflecting an adaptation to mitotic function. A stable balance of force is not established between two antiparallel microtubules with these motors. Instead, directional instability is generated, promoting efficient motor and microtubule sorting. A nonmotor microtubule cross-linker can suppress directional instability but also impedes microtubule sorting, illustrating a conflict between stability and dynamicity of organization. These results establish the basic organizational properties of these antagonistic mitotic motors and a microtubule bundler. {\textcopyright} 2010 Hentrich and Surrey.},

abstract = {Microtubule dynamics have key roles in mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome movement [1]. Fast turnover of spindle microtubules at metaphase and polewards flux of microtubules (polewards movement of the microtubule lattice with depolymerization at the poles) at both metaphase and anaphase have been observed in mammalian cells [2]. Imaging spindle dynamics in genetically tractable yeasts is now possible using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagging of tubulin and sites on chromosomes [3–8]. We used photobleaching of GFP-labeled tubulin to observe microtubule dynamics in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Photobleaching did not perturb progress through mitosis. Bleached marks made on the spindle during metaphase recovered their fluorescence rapidly, indicating fast microtubule turnover. Recovery was spatially non-uniform, but we found no evidence for polewards flux. Marks made during anaphase B did not recover fluorescence, and were observed to slide away from each other at the same rate as spindle elongation. Fast microtubule turnover at metaphase and a switch to stable microtubules at anaphase suggest the existence of a cell-cycle-regulated molecular switch that controls microtubule dynamics and that may be conserved in evolution. Unlike the situation for vertebrate spindles, microtubule depolymerization at poles and polewards flux may not occur in S. pombe mitosis. We conclude that GFP–tubulin photobleaching in conjunction with mutant cells should aid research on molecular mechanisms causing and regulating dynamics.},

The network subsequently gradually reoriented actin filaments along the cell equator. This strictly depended on myosin II activity, suggesting local network reorganization by mechanical forces. Cortical laser microsurgery revealed that during cytokinesis progression, mechanical tension increased substantially along the direction of the cell equator, while the network contracted laterally along the pole-to-pole axis without a detectable increase in tension.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Microtubules are heavily regulated dynamic polymers of $\alpha$$\beta$-tubulin that are required for proper chromosome segregation and organization of the cytoplasm. Polymerases in the XMAP215 family use arrayed TOG domains to promote faster microtubule elongation. Regulatory factors in the cytoplasmic linker associated protein (CLASP) family that reduce catastrophe and/or increase rescue also contain arrayed TOGs, but how CLASP TOGs contribute to activity is poorly understood. Here, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae Stu1 as a model CLASP, we report structural, biochemical, and reconstitution studies that clarify functional properties of CLASP TOGs. The two TOGs in Stu1 have very different tubulin-binding properties: TOG2 binds to both unpolymerized and polymerized tubulin, and TOG1 binds very weakly to either. The structure of Stu1-TOG2 reveals a CLASP-specific residue that likely confers distinctive tubulin-binding properties. The isolated TOG2 domain strongly suppresses microtubule catastrophe and increases microtubule rescue in vitro, contradicting the expectation that regulatory activity requires an array of TOGs. Single point mutations on the tubulin-binding surface of TOG2 ablate its anti-catastrophe and rescue activity in vitro, and Stu1 function in cells. Revealing that an isolated CLASP TOG can regulate polymerization dynamics without being part of an array provides insight into the mechanism of CLASPs and diversifies the understanding of TOG function.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Although the regulating activity of EB1 on microtubule dynamics has been studied in cells and purified systems, the molecular mechanisms involved in its specific activity are still unclear. Here, we describe how EB1 regulates the dynamics and structure of microtubules assembled from pure tubulin. We found that EB1 stimulates spontaneous nucleation and growth of microtubules, and promotes both catastrophes (transitions from growth to shrinkage) and rescues (reverse events). Electron cryomicroscopy showed that EB1 induces the initial formation of tubulin sheets, which rapidly close into the common 13-protofilament-microtubule architecture. Our results suggest that EB1 favours the lateral association of free tubulin at microtubule-sheet edges, thereby stimulating nucleation, sheet growth and closure. The reduction of sheet length at microtubule growing-ends together with the elimination of stressed microtubule lattices may account for catastrophes. Conversely, occasional binding of EB1 to the microtubule lattice may induce rescues.},

abstract = {Key to invasiveness is the ability of tumor cells to modify the extracellular matrix, become motile, and engage in directed migration towards the vasculature. One significant protein associated with metastatic progression is membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP/MMP14). How MMP14 activity is coordinated with other signaling pathways to regulate cell migration in vivo is largely unknown. Here we have used zebrafish embryogenesis as a model to understand the potential relationship between MMP14-dependent pericellular proteolysis, cell polarity, and motility. Knockdown of zebrafish Mmp14 function disrupted gastrulation convergence and extension cell movements and craniofacial morphogenesis. Using time-lapse imaging and morphometric analyses, we show that Mmp14 is required for proper cell polarity underlying the directed migration of mesodermal cells during gastrulation. We have identified a genetic interaction between mmp14 and non-canonical Wnt signaling, a pathway that also regulates cell polarity in embryonic tissues and is increasingly being linked with tumor cell migration. Finally, we demonstrate that Van Gogh-like 2, a key regulator of the non-canonical Wnt pathway, co-localizes with MMP14 and becomes redistributed towards the leading edge of polarized human cancer cells. Together, our results support the notion that pathways regulating pericellular proteolysis and cell polarity converge to promote efficient cell migration.},

abstract = {Accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis requires the physical separation of sister chromatids before nuclear envelope reassembly (NER). However, how these two processes are coordinated remains unknown. Here, we identified a conserved feedback control mechanism that delays chromosome decondensation and NER in response to incomplete chromosome separation during anaphase. A midzone-associated Aurora B gradient was found to monitor chromosome position along the division axis and to prevent premature chromosome decondensation by retaining Condensin I. PP1/PP2A phosphatases counteracted this gradient and promoted chromosome decondensation and NER. Thus, an Aurora B gradient appears to mediate a surveillance mechanism that prevents chromosome decondensation and NER until effective separation of sister chromatids is achieved. This allows the correction and reintegration of lagging chromosomes in the main nuclei before completion of NER.},

The idea is that Aurora B activity prevents NER, so that only chromosomes that are far enough from the midzone (where Aurora B is highest) assemble the NE.

abstract = {Zebrafish gastrulation cell movements occur in the context of dynamic changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and require the concerted action of planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins that regulate cell elongation and mediolateral alignment. Data obtained using Xenopus laevis gastrulae have shown that integrin-fibronectin interactions underlie the formation of polarized cell protrusions necessary for PCP and have implicated PCP proteins themselves as regulators of ECM. By contrast, the relationship between establishment of PCP and ECM assembly/remodeling during zebrafish gastrulation is unclear. We previously showed that zebrafish embryos carrying a null mutation in the four-pass transmembrane PCP protein vang-like 2 (vangl2) exhibit increased matrix metalloproteinase activity and decreased immunolabeling of fibronectin. These data implicated for the first time a core PCP protein in the regulation of pericellular proteolysis of ECM substrates and raised the question of whether other zebrafish PCP proteins also impact ECM organization. In Drosophila melanogaster, the cytoplasmic PCP protein Prickle binds Van Gogh and regulates its function. Here we report that similar to vangl2, loss of zebrafish prickle1a decreases fibronectin protein levels in gastrula embryos. We further show that Prickle1a physically binds Vangl2 and regulates both the subcellular distribution and total protein level of Vangl2. These data suggest that the ability of Prickle1a to impact fibronectin organization is at least partly due to effects on Vangl2. In contrast to loss of either Vangl2 or Prickle1a function, we find that glypican4 (a Wnt co-receptor) and frizzled7 mutant gastrula embryos with disrupted non-canonical Wnt signaling exhibit the opposite phenotype, namely increased fibronectin assembly. Our data show that glypican4 mutants do not have decreased proteolysis of ECM substrates, but instead have increased cell surface cadherin protein expression and increased intercellular adhesion. These data indicate that Wnt/Glypican4/Frizzled signaling regulates ECM assembly through effects on cadherin-mediated cell cohesion. Together, our results demonstrate that zebrafish Vangl2/Prickle1a and non-canonical Wnt/Frizzled signaling have opposing effects on ECM organization underlying PCP and gastrulation cell movements. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Polar ejection forces have often been hypothesized to guide directional instability of mitotic chromosomes, but a direct link has never been established. This has led, in part, to the resurgence of alternative theories. By taking advantage of extremely precise femtosecond pulsed laser microsurgery, we abruptly alter the magnitude of polar ejection forces by severing vertebrate chromosome arms. Results: Reduction of polar ejection forces increases the amplitude of directional instability without altering other characteristics, thus establishing a direct link between polar ejection forces and the direction of chromosome movements. We find that polar ejection forces limit the range of chromosome oscillations by increasing the probability that motors at a leading kinetochore abruptly disengage or turn off, leading to a direction reversal. Conclusions: From the relation between the change in oscillation amplitude and the amount a chromosome arm is shortened, we are able to map the distribution of polar ejection forces across the spindle, which is surprisingly different from previously assumed distributions. These results allow us to differentiate between the mechanisms proposed to underlie the directional instability of chromosomes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Fast growth of microtubules is essential for rapid assembly of the microtubule cytoskeleton during cell proliferation and differentiation. XMAP215 belongs to a conserved family of proteins that promote microtubule growth. To determine how XMAP215 accelerates growth, we developed a single-molecule assay to visualize directly XMAP215-GFP interacting with dynamic microtubules. XMAP215 binds free tubulin in a 1:1 complex that interacts with the microtubule lattice and targets the ends by a diffusion-facilitated mechanism. XMAP215 persists at the plus end for many rounds of tubulin subunit addition in a form of "tip tracking." These results show that XMAP215 is a processive polymerase that directly catalyzes the addition of up to 25 tubulin dimers to the growing plus end. Under some circumstances XMAP215 can also catalyze the reverse reaction, namely microtubule shrinkage. The similarities between XMAP215 and formins, actin polymerases, suggest that processive tip tracking is a common mechanism for stimulating the growth of cytoskeletal polymers. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

CMG2 is the main receptor of the anthrax toxin, and knocking out this gene in mice renders them insensitive to infection with Bacillus anthracis spores. On the other hand, mutations in CMG2 lead to a rare but severe autosomal recessive disorder in humans called Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome (HFS). We will here review what is known about the structure of CMG2 and its ability to mediate anthrax toxin entry into cell. We will then describe the limited knowledge available concerning the physiological role of CMG2.

abstract = {Poleward microtubule flux is a conserved process during mitosis and meiosis in metazoan cells and is defined as the translocation of spindle microtubules toward spindle poles coupled to the depolymerization of their minus-ends. In some cell types, the rate of poleward microtubule flux matches that of poleward chromatid movement during anaphase A, suggesting that it pulls chromatids poleward. However, in other cell types, the rate of poleward microtubule flux is significantly slower than chromatid movement during anaphase A, suggesting that it makes little contribution to chromatid movement. This discrepancy led to speculation that flux is maintained in these cells to fulfill other functional roles aside from contributing to anaphase A chromatid movement. These roles include contributing to chromosome alignment, regulating spindle size and microtubule turnover, and correcting errors in chromosome attachment to spindle microtubules. Here, we discuss recent data that begin to pinpoint the functional roles of poleward microtubule flux during mitosis and meiosis. {\textcopyright}2006 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) can arise from either developmental or postdevelopmental processes. Recessive PKD, caused by mutations in PKHD1, is a developmental defect, whereas dominant PKD, caused by mutations in PKD1 or PKD2, occurs by a cellular recessive mechanism in mature kidneys. Oriented cell division is a feature of planar cell polarity that describes the orientation of the mitotic axes of dividing cells during development with respect to the luminal vector of the elongating nephron. In polycystic mutant mice, the loss of oriented cell division may also contribute to the pathogenesis of PKD. Here, we examined the role of oriented cell division in mouse models based on mutations in Pkd1, Pkd2, and Pkhd1. Precystic tubules after kidney-selective inactivation of either Pkd1 or Pkd2 did not lose oriented division before cystic dilation but lost oriented division after tubular dilation began. In contrast, Pkhd1(del4/del4) mice lost oriented cell division but did not develop kidney cysts. Increased intercalation of cells into the plane of the tubular epithelium maintained the normal tubular morphology in Pkhd1(del4/del4) mice, which had more cells present in transverse tubular profiles. In conclusion, loss of oriented cell division is a feature of Pkhd1 mutation and cyst formation, but it is neither sufficient to produce kidney cysts nor required to initiate cyst formation after mutation in Pkd1 or Pkd2.},

How these kinases mechanistically coordinate their important functions is only partially understood. Here, using budding yeast, we identify a regulatory mechanism by which the Cdk1 kinase Cdc28 directly controls the Aurora kinase Ipl1. We show that Cdk1 phosphorylates Ipl1 on two serine residues in the N-terminal domain, thereby suppressing its association with the microtubule plus-end tracking protein Bim1 until the onset of anaphase. Failure to phosphorylate Ipl1 leads to its premature targeting to the metaphase spindle and results in constitutive Bim1 phosphorylation, which is normally restricted to anaphase. Cells expressing an Ipl1-Sli15 complex that cannot be phosphorylated by Cdk1 display a severe growth defect. Our work shows that Ipl1/Aurora is not only the catalytic subunit of the CPC but also an important regulatory target that allows Cdk1 to coordinate chromosome biorientation with spindle morphogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In higher eukaryotes, efficient chromosome congression relies, among other players, on the activity of chromokinesins. Here, we provide a quantitative analysis of kinetochore oscillations and positioning in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a model organism lacking chromokinesins. In wild-type cells, chromosomes align during prophase and, while oscillating, maintain this alignment throughout metaphase. Chromosome oscillations are dispensable both for kinetochore congression and stable kinetochore alignment during metaphase. In higher eukaryotes, kinesin-8 family members control chromosome congression by regulating their oscillations. By contrast, here, we demonstrate that fission yeast kinesin-8 controls chromosome congression by an alternative mechanism. We propose that kinesin-8 aligns chromosomes by controlling pulling forces in a length-dependent manner. A coarse-grained model of chromosome segregation implemented with a length-dependent process that controls the force at kinetochores is necessary and sufficient to mimic kinetochore alignment, and prevents the appearance of lagging chromosomes. Taken together, these data illustrate how the local action of a motor protein at kinetochores provides spatial cues within the spindle to align chromosomes and to prevent aneuploidy.},
annote = {Klp5 deletion leaves kinetochores close to spindle poles.

The frequency of the oscillations does not change removing kinesin-8 or adding TBZ, but it does change the amplitude. Kinesin-8 removal increases amplitude, while TBZ reduces amplitude. In HeLa this kinesin-8 dampening of oscillations has also been observed.

They see big drifts in chromosome trajectories when they remove kinesin-8. These large drifts correspond to loss of attachment, judging from the flashes of Mad2 that appear prior to them. In this lines, they see that the drift speed is the same as the anaphase A separation speed of the chromosomes, suggesting that it must be driven by depolymerisation.

They say that this events of transient detachment cannot be the reason why chromsomes fail to align at the center of the spindle, because when they use TBZ in klp5D, the kinetochores are not released (no drift events with Mad2 loading), but the centering errors persist.},

abstract = {Despite the crowdedness of the interior of cells, microtubule-based motor proteins are able to deliver cargoes rapidly and reliably throughout the cytoplasm. We hypothesize that motor proteins may be adapted to operate in crowded environments by having molecular properties that prevent them from forming traffic jams. To test this hypothesis, we reconstituted high-density traffic of purified kinesin-8 motor protein, a highly processive motor with long end-residency time, along microtubules in a total internal-reflection fluorescence microscopy assay. We found that traffic jams, characterized by an abrupt increase in the density of motors with an associated abrupt decrease in motor speed, form even in the absence of other obstructing proteins. To determine the molecular properties that lead to jamming, we altered the concentration of motors, their processivity, and their rate of dissociation from microtubule ends. Traffic jams occurred when the motor density exceeded a critical value (density-induced jams) or when motor dissociation from the microtubule ends was so slow that it resulted in a pileup (bottleneck-induced jams). Through comparison of our experimental results with theoretical models and stochastic simulations, we characterized in detail under which conditions densityand bottleneck-induced traffic jams form or do not form. Our results indicate that transport kinesins, such as kinesin-1, may be evolutionarily adapted to avoid the formation of traffic jams by moving only with moderate processivity and dissociating rapidly from microtubule ends.},

While the minus ends of most kMTs are near the poles, those of the ipMTs are spread over half of the spindle length, with at least 50{\%} lying {\textgreater} 1.5 microns from the poles. Longitudinal views of the ipMT bundles demonstrate a major rearrangement of their plus ends between mid- and late anaphase B. However, the minus ends of these MTs do not move appreciably farther from the spindle midplane, suggesting that sliding of these MTs contributes little to anaphase B. The minus ends of ipMTs are markedly clustered in the bundles of kMTs throughout anaphase A. These ends lie close to kMTs much more frequently than would be expected by chance, suggesting a specific interaction. As sister kinetochores separate and kMTs shorten, the minus ends of the kMTs remain associated with the spindle poles, but the minus ends of many ipMTs are released from the kMT bundles, allowing the spindle pole and the kMTs to move away from the ipMTs as the spindle elongates.},

abstract = {Background information. In eukaryotic cells, proper formation of the spindle is necessary for successful cell division. For faithful segregation of sister chromatids, each sister kinetochore must attach to microtubules that extend to opposite poles (chromosome bi-orientation). At the metaphase-anaphase transition, cohesion between sister chromatids is removed, and each sister chromatid is pulled to opposite poles of the cell by microtubule-dependent forces. Results. We have studied the role of the minus-end-directed motor protein dynein by analysing kinetochore dynamics in fission yeast cells deleted for the dynein heavy chain (Dhc1) or the light chain (Dic1). In these mutants, we found an increased frequency of cells showing defects in chromosome segregation, which leads to the appearance of lagging chromosomes and an increased rate of chromosome loss. By following simultaneously kinetochore dynamics and localization of the checkpoint protein Mad2, we provide evidence that dynein function is not necessary for spindle-assembly checkpoint inactivation. Instead, we have demonstrated that loss of dynein function alters chromosome segregation and activates the Mad2-dependent spindle-assembly checkpoint. Conclusions. These results show an unexpected role for dynein in the control of chromosome segregation in fission yeast, most probably operating during the process of bi-orientation during early mitosis.},

abstract = {Glycine and proline residues are frequently found in turn and loop structures of proteins and are believed to play an important role during chain compaction early in folding. We investigated their effect on the dynamics of intrachain loop formation in various unstructured polypeptide chains. Loop formation is significantly slower around trans prolyl peptide bonds and faster around glycine residues compared to any other amino acid. However, short loops are formed fastest around cis prolyl bonds with a time constant of 6 ns for end-to-end contact formation in a four-residue loop. Formation of short loops encounters activation energies in the range of 15 to 30 kJ/mol. The altered dynamics around glycine and trans prolyl bonds can be mainly ascribed to their effects on the activation energy. The fast dynamics around cis prolyl bonds, in contrast, originate in a higher Arrhenius pre-exponential factor, which compensates for an increased activation energy for loop formation compared to trans isomers. All-atom simulations of proline-containing peptides indicate that the conformational space for cis prolyl isomers is largely restricted compared to trans isomers. This leads to decreased average end-to-end distances and to a smaller loss in conformational entropy upon loop formation in cis isomers. The results further show that glycine and proline residues only influence formation of short loops containing between 2 and 10 residues, which is the typical loop size in native proteins. Formation of larger loops is not affected by the presence of a single glycine or proline residue.},

This balance is achieved, in part, through kinesin-8 proteins (such as Kip3p in budding yeast and KLP67A in Drosophila) that destabilize microtubules3-8. Here, we directly demonstrate that Kip3p destabilizes microtubules by depolymerizing them - accounting for the effects of kinesin-8 perturbations on microtubule and spindle length observed in fungi and metazoan cells. Furthermore, using single-molecule microscopy assays9, we show that Kip3p has several properties that distinguish it from other depolymerizing kinesins, such as the kinesin-13 MCAK10,11. First, Kip3p disassembles microtubules exclusively at the plus end and second, remarkably, Kip3p depolymerizes longer microtubules faster than shorter ones. These properties are consequences of Kip3p being a highly processive, plus-end-directed motor12, both in vitro and in vivo. Length-dependent depolymerization provides a new mechanism for controlling the lengths of subcellular structures13.},

We identified a centromeric protein, Nuf2, which is conserved in fission yeast, human, nematode, and budding yeast. Gene disruption of nuf2+ in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe caused defects in chromosome segregation and the spindle checkpoint: the mitotic spindle elongated without segregating the chromosomes, indicating that spindle function was compromised, but that this abnormality did not result in metaphase arrest. Certain nuf2 temperature-sensitive mutations, however, caused metaphase arrest with condensed chromosomes and a short spindle, indicating that, while these mutations caused abnormalities in spindle function, the spindle checkpoint pathway remained intact. Metaphase arrest in these cells was dependent on the spindle checkpoint component Mad2. Interestingly, Nuf2 disappeared from the centromere during meiotic prophase when centromeres lose their connection to the spindle pole body. We propose that Nuf2 acts at the centromere to establish a connection with the spindle for proper chromosome segregation, and that Nuf2 function is also required for the spindle checkpoint.},

However, none of the plant microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) so far purified accounts for the observed separation between MTs in cells. We previously isolated from carrot cytoskeletons a MAP fraction including 120- and 65-kDa MAPs and have now separated the 65-kDa carrot MAP by sucrose density centrifugation. MAP65 does not induce tubulin polymerization but induces the formation of bundles of parallel MTs in a nucleotide-insensitive manner. The bundling effect is inhibited by porcine MAP2, but, unlike MAP2, MAP65 is heat-labile. In the electron microscope, MAP65 appears as filamentous cross-bridges, maintaining an intermicrotubule spacing of 25-30 nm. Microdensitometer-computer correlation analysis reveals that the cross-bridges are regularly spaced, showing a regular axial spacing that is compatible with a symmetrical helical superlattice for 13 protofilament MTs. Because MAP65 maintains in vitro the inter-MT spacing observed in plants and is shown to decorate cortical MTs, it is proposed that this MAP is important for the organization of the cortical array in vivo.},

Interestingly, in C. elegans embryos, this goes along with temporal regulation: larger cells speed up spindle assembly and elongation. We demonstrate that, similarly in fission yeast, spindle length and spindle dynamics adjust to cell size, which allows to keep mitosis duration constant. Since prolongation of mitosis was shown to affect cell viability, this may resemble a mechanism to regulate mitosis duration. We further reveal how the velocity of spindle elongation is regulated: coupled to cell size, the amount of kinesin-6 Klp9 molecules increases, resulting in an acceleration of spindle elongation in anaphase B. In addition, the number of Klp9 binding sites to microtubules increases overproportionally to Klp9 molecules, suggesting that molecular crowding inversely correlates to cell size and might have an impact on spindle elongation velocity control.},

Using a three-bead optical trapping assay, we recorded NMIIB interactions with actin filaments to determine if a NMIIB dimer cycles along an actin filament in a processive manner. Our results show that NMIIB is the first myosin II to exhibit evidence of processive stepping behavior. Analysis of these data reveals a forward displacement of 5.4 nm and, surprisingly, frequent backward steps of -5.9 nm. Processive stepping along the long pitch helix of actin may provide a mechanism for disassembly of fascin-actin bundles. Forward steps and detachment are weakly force-dependent at all forces, consistent with rate-limiting and force-dependent ADP release. However, backward steps are nearly force-independent. Our data support a model in which NMIIB can readily move in both directions at stall, which may be important for a general regulator of cytoskeleton tension.},

abstract = {Tethering kinetochores at spindle poles facilitates their efficient capture and segregation by microtubules at mitotic onset in yeast. During meiotic prophase of fission yeast, however, kinetochores are detached from the poles, which facilitates meiotic recombination but may cause a risk of chromosome mis-segregation during meiosis. How cells circumvent this dilemma remains unclear. Here we show that an extensive microtubule array assembles from the poles at meiosis I onset and retrieves scattered kinetochores towards the poles to prevent chromosome drift. Moreover, the microtubule-associated protein complex Alp7-Alp14 (the fission yeast orthologues of mammalian TACC-TOG) is phosphorylated by Polo kinase, which promotes its meiosis-specific association to the outer kinetochore complex Nuf2-Ndc80 of scattered kinetochores, thereby assisting in capturing remote kinetochores. Although TOG was recently characterized as a microtubule polymerase, Dis1 (the other TOG orthologue in fission yeast), together with the Dam1 complex, plays a role in microtubule shortening to pull kinetochores polewards. Thus, microtubules and their binding proteins uniquely reconstitute chromosome configuration during meiosis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

However, mitotic exit was recently shown to be a function of chromosome separation during anaphase, assisted by a midzone Aurora B phosphorylation gradient-the ‘ruler' model. Here we found that Cdk1 remains active during anaphase due to ongoing APC/CCdc20- and APC/CCdh1-mediated degradation of B-type Cyclins in Drosophila and human cells. Failure to degrade B-type Cyclins during anaphase prevented mitotic exit in a Cdk1-dependent manner. Cyclin B1-Cdk1 localized at the spindle midzone in an Aurora B-dependent manner, with incompletely separated chromosomes showing the highest Cdk1 activity. Slowing down anaphase chromosome motion delayed Cyclin B1 degradation and mitotic exit in an Aurora B-dependent manner. Thus, a crosstalk between molecular ‘rulers' and ‘clocks' licenses mitotic exit only after proper chromosome separation.},

Mitotic exit can also be delayed by inactivation of APC/cdh1 or by mutating the target sequence of this APC (KEN box) in Cyclin Bs

Mitotic exit is delayed also with proteasome inhibitors, in which cells form metaphase-like spindles after nuclei segregate. In this background, mitotic exit can be achieved by inhibiting Cdk1, but not Aurora B activity

There is a small pool of Cyclin B at the midzone

This pool is enhanced in cells with Cdk1 inhibition, since they have higher levels of Cyclin B when going to anaphase.

Localization is inhibited by siRNA for kinesin-6, which also is required for aurora B localization to the midzone.

Aurora inhibition reduces this midzone pool of Cyc-B.

OE of Aurora delays recruitment of Aurora and CycB to the midzone, and delays anaphase. they find that the time/delay of recruitment of Aurora to the midzone correlates with duration of anaphase/ delay in mitotic exit.

Kinesin-6 siRNA also causes a delay in CycB degradation.

Inhibition of Aurora B does not accelerate Cyc B degradation, nor change anaphase duration. No effect by changing the activity of PP1

Chromosome segreagation delay slows down cycB degradation, and Aurora B activity is required for this delay (since Aurora inhibition restores normal CycB degradation)},

abstract = {The ploidy cycle, which is integral to sexual reproduction, requires meiosis to halve chromosome numbers as well as mechanisms that ensure zygotes are formed by exactly two partners1–4. During sexual reproduction of the fungal model organism Schizosaccharomyces pombe, haploid P and M cells fuse to form a diploid zygote that immediately enters meiosis5. Here we reveal that rapid post-fusion reconstitution of a bipartite transcription factor blocks re-fertilization. We first identify mutants that undergo transient cell fusion involving cytosol exchange but not karyogamy, and show that this drives distinct cell fates in the two gametes. The P partner undergoes lethal haploid meiosis, whereas the M cell persists in mating. The zygotic transcription that drives meiosis is rapidly initiated first from the P parental genome, even in wild-type cells. This asymmetric gene expression depends on a bipartite complex formed post-fusion between the cytosolic M-cell-specific peptide Mi and the nuclear P-cell-specific homeobox protein Pi6,7, which captures Mi in the P nucleus. Zygotic transcription is thus poised to initiate in the P nucleus as fast as Mi reaches it after fusion, a design that we reconstruct using two synthetic interactors localized to the nucleus and the cytosol of two respective partner cells. Notably, delaying zygotic transcription—by postponing Mi expression or deleting its transcriptional target in the P genome—leads to zygotes fusing with additional gametes, thus forming polyploids and eventually aneuploid progeny. The signalling cascade to block re-fertilization shares components with, but bifurcates from, meiotic induction8–10. Thus, a cytoplasmic connection upon gamete fusion leads to asymmetric reconstitution of a bipartite transcription factor to rapidly block re-fertilization and induce meiosis, ensuring genome maintenance during sexual reproduction.},

annote = {• cdh1D in budding yeast is an APC cofactor for mitotic exit. Involved in degradation of Ase1 and Cin8 in yeast, also Fin1, which has no homologue in Pombe
○ Srw1 is the fission yeast equivalent
○ Mfr1 is the meiotic version (from uniprot and pombase)
○ Cdh1D cells end anaphase with cut from cytokinetic ring, and the part that keeps the midzone remains stable.
• Inactivation of the MEN arrests cells in late anaphase with an intact spindle (Visintin and Amon 2001), but the spindle breaks when you affect the APC or the kip3. This is because the cytokinetic ring cuts the spindle (the cytokinetic ring would not cut if the MEN is inactive)
• ﻿Mutant alleles of all nine genes caused delays in spindle disassembly (Fig. 3 B). Doc1 is a subunit of the APC (Hwang and Murray, 1997), and Dbf2 is a downstream component of the MEN that indirectly activates APC-Cdh1 (Visintin et al., 1998). Ipl1 is the essential Aurora B kinase in yeast implicated previously in spindle disassembly (Buvelot et al., 2003), and Mcm21 is a com- ponent of the COMA kinetochore complex shown to affect Ipl1localization (Vizeacoumar et al., 2010). Finally, Dcc1 and Ctf8 are components of the seven-protein alternative replication factor C (A-RFC) complex that regulates sister chromatid cohesion (Mayer et al., 2001). Like She1, Dcc1 and Ctf8 have not previously been linked to spindle disassembly.

• Aurora-ts inactivation
○ No removal of EB1, same with EB1-6A
○ Delayed spindle disassembly
○ However, they don't see super-stable spindle halves!
○ The ideal experiment is Aurora B that is only affected during anaphase. How to do this? Metaphase block? GBP-Aurora?
• A-RFC complex (dcc1D ctf8D)
○ EB1 not removed
○ Seems to be in the same path as Aurora
○ What is this in Pombe?
• They use cdc15 inactivation to arrest cells in late anaphase
○ This is cdc7 in Pombe

• Previously some factor (Mcm21) was proposed to be upstream of Aurora, they see that deleting it does not change Aurora localisation, but does delay spindle disassembly.
• This She1 protein does not exist in Pombe.
• Questions
○ Why regulating microtubule dynamics once there is no CLASP anymore?
○ Is anaphase duration really altered in Klp9D, or is it just spindle disassembly?},

This multitasking is achieved through the activity of numerous microtubule-associated proteins. Two prominent classes of proteins are central to the selective recognition of distinct transiently existing structural features of the microtubule cytoskeleton. They define local functionality through tightly regulated protein recruitment. Here we summarize the recent developments in elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying the action of microtubule end-binding proteins (EBs) and antiparallel microtubule crosslinkers of the Ase1/PRC1 family that represent the core of these two recruitment modules.

abstract = {Tissue morphogenesis arises from coordinated changes in cell shape driven by actomyosin contractions. Patterns of gene expression regionalize cell behaviours by controlling actomyosin contractility. Here we report two modes of control over Rho1 and myosin II (MyoII) activation in the Drosophila endoderm. First, Rho1–MyoII are induced in a spatially restricted primordium via localized transcription of the G-protein-coupled receptor ligand Fog. Second, a tissue-scale wave of Rho1–MyoII activation and cell invagination progresses anteriorly away from the primordium. The wave does not require sustained gene transcription, and is not governed by regulated Fog delivery. Instead, MyoII inhibition blocks Rho1 activation and propagation, revealing a mechanical feedback driven by MyoII. We find that MyoII activation and invagination in each row of cells drives adhesion to the vitelline membrane mediated by integrins, apical spreading, MyoII activation and invagination in the next row. Endoderm morphogenesis thus emerges from local transcriptional initiation and a mechanically driven cycle of cell deformation.},

The challenge of modeling mechanical properties of microtubules is to achieve both computational efficiency and accuracy. Various kinds of techniques have been adopted and created in practice. Atomistic simulation method is useful for simulation of atomic structures, however, because of computational limitations, it is not realistic to adopt it for modeling of long microtubules which involve billions of atoms. Classical continuum mechanics does not incorporate fundamental atomic interactions. Bridging-scale techniques are developed to address the problems in traditional macroscopic and microscopic modeling, which combine the intrinsic interatomic potential and continuum mechanical solution frameworks, hence possess merits in both atomic simulation and computational continuum mechanics. In view of the fast development in this research topic, this article provides a general review of the past and recent advances in mechanical properties and characterization of microtubules.},

abstract = {Cut7, the sole kinesin-5 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, is essential for mitosis. Like other yeast kinesin-5 motors, Cut7 can reverse its stepping direction, by mechanisms that are currently unclear. Here we show that for full-length Cut7, the key determinant of stepping direction is the degree of motor crowding on the microtubule lattice, with greater crowding converting the motor from minus end-directed to plus end-directed stepping. To explain how high Cut7 occupancy causes this reversal, we postulate a simple proximity sensing mechanism that operates via steric blocking. We propose that the minus end-directed stepping action of Cut7 is selectively inhibited by collisions with neighbors under crowded conditions, whereas its plus end-directed action, being less space-hungry, is not. In support of this idea, we show that the direction of Cut7-driven microtubule sliding can be reversed by crowding it with non-Cut7 proteins. Thus, crowding by either dynein microtubule binding domain or Klp2, a kinesin-14, converts Cut7 from net minus end-directed to net plus end-directed stepping. Biochemical assays confirm that the Cut7 N terminus increases Cut7 occupancy by binding directly to microtubules. Direct observation by cryoEM reveals that this occupancy-enhancing N-terminal domain is partially ordered. Overall, our data point to a steric blocking mechanism for directional reversal through which collisions of Cut7 motor domains with their neighbors inhibit their minus end-directed stepping action, but not their plus end-directed stepping action. Our model can potentially reconcile a number of previous, apparently conflicting, observations and proposals for the reversal mechanism of yeast kinesins-5.},

The length of the spindle at the delay point (3-4 $\mu$m) is not dependent on the physical distance between the two centromeres, indicating that the arrest represents surveillance of a dicentric induced aberration. No mid-anaphase delay is observed in the absence of the RAD9 checkpoint gene, which prevents cell cycle progression in the presence of damaged DNA. These observations reveal RAD9-dependent events well past the G2/M boundary and have considerable implications in understanding how chromosome integrity and the position and state of the mitotic spindle are monitored before cytokinesis.},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CLASP activity are not understood. Here, we use purified protein components and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to investigate the effects of human CLASP2 on microtubule dynamics in vitro. We demonstrate that CLASP2 suppresses microtubule catastrophe and promotes rescue without affecting the rates of microtubule growth or shrinkage. Strikingly, when CLASP2 is combined with EB1, a known binding partner, the effects on microtubule dynamics are strongly enhanced. We show that synergy between CLASP2 and EB1 is dependent on a direct interaction, since a truncated EB1 protein that lacks the CLASP2-binding domain does not enhance CLASP2 activity. Further, we find that EB1 targets CLASP2 to microtubules and increases the dwell time of CLASP2 at microtubule tips. Although the temporally averaged microtubule growth rates are unaffected by CLASP2, we find that microtubules grown with CLASP2 display greater variability in growth rates. Our results provide insight into the regulation of microtubule dynamics by CLASP proteins and highlight the importance of the functional interplay between regulatory proteins at dynamic microtubule ends.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The mitotic spindle is a dynamic bipolar structure that mediates chromosome segregation in mitosis. In most organisms, spindle formation requires the action of kinesin-5 motor proteins that generate outward force on antiparallel microtubules to establish spindle bipolarity. Previous work has shown that Eg5 and TPX2, a spindle microtubule-associated protein that suppresses Eg5 motor activity, are enriched on parallel microtubules near spindle poles. This distribution is inconsistent with the requirement for Eg5-dependent force production during mitosis. To investigate this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to tag Eg5 and TPX2 with EGFP and quantify protein distribution throughout mitosis. The results show that at metaphase both Eg5–EGFP and TPX2–EGFP are enriched toward spindle poles, but only TPX2–EGFP is enriched relative to microtubules. Eg5–EGFP and TPX2–EGFP show distinct localization patterns in anaphase, with Eg5–EGFP relocalizing to the midzone earlier than TPX2–EGFP. Analysis of spindles oriented at 90° to the coverslip confirmed that Eg5–EGFP was present on bridge microtubules in metaphase and anaphase; in contrast, TPX2 was not enriched, or enriched at later times, on these microtubules. Overall, TPX2 was present at 3.6X the level of Eg5 on the spindle and Eg5 was locally enriched at the prophase centrosome ({\~{}}7×) compared to the whole cell. Our results show that using cells with fluorescent tags at the endogenous locus can provide novel insight into protein distribution during mitosis.},

abstract = {Spindle microtubules, whose dynamics vary over time and at different locations, cooperatively drive chromosome segregation. Measurements of microtubule dynamics and spindle ultrastructure can provide insight into the behaviors of microtubules, helping elucidate the mechanism of chromosome segregation. Much work has focused on the dynamics and organization of kinetochore microtubules, that is, on the region between chromosomes and poles. In comparison, microtubules in the central-spindle region, between segregating chromosomes, have been less thoroughly characterized. Here, we report measurements of the movement of central-spindle microtubules during chromosome segregation in human mitotic spindles and Caenorhabditis elegans mitotic and female meiotic spindles. We found that these central-spindle microtubules slide apart at the same speed as chromosomes, even as chromosomes move toward spindle poles. In these systems, damaging central-spindle microtubules by laser ablation caused an immediate and complete cessation of chromosome motion, suggesting a strong coupling between central-spindle microtubules and chromosomes. Electron tomographic reconstruction revealed that the analyzed anaphase spindles all contain microtubules with both ends between segregating chromosomes. Our results provide new dynamical, functional, and ultrastructural characterizations of central-spindle microtubules during chromosome segregation in diverse spindles and suggest that central-spindle microtubules and chromosomes are strongly coupled in anaphase.},

Kinesin-5 crosslinks and slides anti-parallel microtubules (MTs), but it is unclear how these two activities contribute to the first steps in spindle formation. In this study, we report that in monopolar spindles, the duplicated spindle poles snap apart in a fast and irreversible step that produces a nascent bipolar spindle. Using mutations in Kinesin-5 that inhibit microtubule sliding, we show that the fast, irreversible pole separation is primarily driven by microtubule crosslinking. Electron tomography revealed microtubule pairs in monopolar spindles have short overlaps that intersect at high angles and are unsuited for ensemble Kinesin-5 sliding. However, maximal extension of a subset of anti-parallel microtubule pairs approaches the length of nascent bipolar spindles and is consistent with a Kinesin-5 crosslinking-driven transition. Nonetheless, microtubule sliding by Kinesin-5 contributes to stabilizing the nascent spindle and setting its stereotyped equilibrium length.},

Here we show that Mal3, an EB1 family tip-tracking protein, drives tubulin to assemble in vitro into exclusively 13-protofilament microtubules with a high proportion of A-lattice protofilament contacts. We present a three-dimensional cryo-EM reconstruction of a purely A-lattice microtubule decorated with Mal3, in which Mal3 occupies the groove between protofilaments and associates closely with one tubulin monomer. We propose that Mal3 promotes assembly by binding to freshly formed tubulin polymer and particularly favors any with A-lattice arrangement.

The ability to incorporate unnatural amino acids (UAA) into proteins in a site specific manner can vastly expand the repertoire of protein functions and also allows detailed analysis of protein function. In recent years UAAs have been incorporated in a site-specific manner into proteins in a number of organisms. In nearly all cases, the amber codon is used as a sense codon, and an orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (RS) pair is used to generate amber suppressing tRNAs charged with the UAA. In this work, we have developed tools to incorporate the cross-linking amino acid azido-phenylalanine (AzF) through the use of bacterial tRNA Tyr and a modified version of TyrRS, AzFRS, in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which is an attractive model organism for the study of cell behavior and function. We have incorporated AzF into three different proteins. We show that the majority of AzF is modified to amino-phenyl alanine, but protein cross-linking was still observed.

abstract = {Faithful segregation of sister chromatids requires the attachment of each kinetochore (Kt) to microtubules (MTs) that extend from opposite spindle poles. Merotelic Kt orientation is a Kt-MT misattachment in which a single Kt binds MTs from both spindle poles rather than just one. Genetic induction of merotelic Kt attachment during anaphase in fission yeast resulted in intra-Kt stretching followed by either correction or Kt disruption. Laser ablation of spindle MTs revealed that intra-Kt stretching and merotelic correction were dependent on MT forces. The presence of multiple merotelic chromosomes linearly antagonized the spindle elongation rate, and this phenomenon could be solved numerically using a simple force balance model. Based on the predictions of our mechanical model, we provide in vivo evidence that correction of merotelic attachment in anaphase is tension dependent and requires an Ase1/Prc1-dependent mechanism that prevents spindle collapse and thus asymmetric division and/or the appearance of the cut phenotype.},
annote = {THey are focused on merotelic attachment -{\textgreater} one kinetochore bound to two spbs at the same time.

What they see is that in anaphase, a kinetochore that is bound to two spbs at the same time (One chromatid only, its not that they have not separated) forms two dots, which they interpret as a stretched kinetochore (only one). The mean maximum stretch is 1.5 um, that is a lot.

When they cut with laser in the case of this merotelic, the dots go to the uncut side.

Interestingly, the merotelic attachments are able to slow down the spindle elongation, more merotelic attachments result in slower speed, and as they are resolved speed increases. Absolutely amazing

Also, when they remove ase1, the spindle colapses when losing contact due to the tension in the kinetochore},

abstract = {To understand the hierarchy of developmental controls underlying axis specification in vertebrate embryos, it is helpful to identify relationships between regulatory molecules and the genes that give axial cells their differentiated phenotypes. This work reports the cloning and expression pattern of one of these differentiation genes, a type II collagen (col2a1) gene from the zebrafish Danio rerio. Along the embryonic axis, col2a1 is expressed dynamically in three rows that are each a single cell wide: the notochord and the rows of cells immediately dorsal and ventral to it--the floor plate of the central nervous system, and the hypochord. In addition, col2a1 is expressed in the pharyngeal arches, the epithelium of the otic capsule, and in the mesenchyme of the neurocranium. Experiments probed the expression pattern of col2a1 relative to that of known or potential regulators of axis development, including axial, sonic hedgehog, twist, and cyclops. The results showed that the spatial and temporal pattern of col2a1 expression in axial mesoderm follows the expression of twist closer than other genes tested. In cyclops embryos, which lack an intact floor plate, col2a1 expression was usually low, but not missing in cells in the ventral spinal cord. Because col2a1 expression reveals abnormalities in the notochord of cyclopsb16 embryos, and less col2a1-expressing mesenchyme accumulates rostral to the notochord in cyclops embryos, the effects of the cyclopsb16 mutation are not confined to the central nervous system.},

abstract = {Short regions of overlap between ends of antiparallel microtubules are central elements within bipolar microtubule arrays. Although their formation requires motors, recent in vitro studies demonstrated that stable overlaps cannot be generated by molecular motors alone. Motors either slide microtubules along each other until complete separation or, in the presence of opposing motors, generate oscillatory movements. Here, we show that Ase1, a member of the conserved MAP65/PRC1 family of microtubule-bundling proteins, enables the formation of stable antiparallel overlaps through adaptive braking of Kinesin-14-driven microtubule-microtubule sliding. As overlapping microtubules start to slide apart, Ase1 molecules become compacted in the shrinking overlap and the sliding velocity gradually decreases in a dose-dependent manner. Compaction is driven by moving microtubule ends that act as barriers to Ase1 diffusion. Quantitative modelling showed that the molecular off-rate of Ase1 is sufficiently low to enable persistent overlap stabilization over tens of minutes. The finding of adaptive braking demonstrates that sliding can be slowed down locally to stabilize overlaps at the centre of bipolar arrays, whereas sliding proceeds elsewhere to enable network self-organization.},

abstract = {Microtubules are essential for a variety of fundamental cellular processes such as organelle positioning and control of cell shape. Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an ideal organism for studying the function and organization of microtubules into bundles in interphase cells. Using light microscopy and electron tomography we analyzed the bundle organization of interphase microtubules in S. pombe. We show that cells lacking ase1p and klp2p still contain microtubule bundles. In addition, we show that ase1p is the major determinant of inter-microtubule spacing in interphase bundles since ase1 deleted cells have an inter-microtubule spacing that differs from that observed in wild-type cells. We then identified dis1p, a XMAP215 homologue, as factor that promotes the stabilization of microtubule bundles. In wild-type cells dis1p partially co-localized with ase1p at regions of microtubule overlap. In cells deleted for ase1 and klp2, dis1p accumulated at the overlap regions of interphase microtubule bundles. In cells lacking all three proteins, both microtubule bundling and inter-microtubule spacing were further reduced, suggesting that Dis1p contributes to interphase microtubule bundling.},

abstract = {Localization of the actin crosslinking protein, alpha-actinin, to the cleavage furrow has been previously reported. However, its functions during cytokinesis remain poorly understood. We have analyzed the functions of alpha-actinin during cytokinesis by a combination of molecular manipulations and imaging-based techniques. alpha-actinin gradually dissipated from the cleavage furrow as cytokinesis progressed. Overexpression of alpha-actinin caused increased accumulation of actin filaments because of inhibition of actin turnover, leading to cytokinesis failure. Global depletion of alpha-actinin by siRNA caused a decrease in the density of actin filaments throughout the cell cortex, surprisingly inducing accelerated cytokinesis and ectopic furrows. Local ablation of alpha-actinin induced accelerated cytokinesis specifically at the site of irradiation. Neither overexpression nor depletion of alpha-actinin had an apparent effect on myosin II organization. We conclude that cytokinesis in mammalian cells requires tightly regulated remodeling of the cortical actin network mediated by alpha-actinin in coordination with actomyosin-based cortical contractions.},

Is protofilament tracking an inherent property of processive kinesin motors, like kinesin-1, and what are the structural determinants underlying protofilament tracking? To address these questions, we investigated the tracking properties of the processive kinesin-8, Kip3. Using in vitro gliding motility assays, we found that Kip3 rotates microtubules counterclockwise around their longitudinal axes with periodicities of ∼1 $\mu$m. These rotations indicate that the motors switch protofilaments with a bias toward the left. Molecular modeling suggests 1), that the protofilament switching may be due to kinesin-8 having a longer neck linker than kinesin-1, and 2), that the leftward bias is due the asymmetric geometry of the motor neck linker complex. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Kinetochores remain attached to microtubule (MT) tips during mitosis even as the tips assemble and disassemble under their grip, allowing filament dynamics to produce force and move chromosomes. The specific proteins that mediate tip attachment are uncertain, and the mechanism of MT-dependent force production is unknown. Recent work suggests that the Dam1 complex, an essential component of kinetochores in yeast, may contribute directly to kinetochore-MT attachment and force production, perhaps by forming a sliding ring encircling the MT. To test these hypotheses, we developed an in vitro motility assay where beads coated with pure recombinant Dam1 complex were bound to the tips of individual dynamic MTs. The Dam1-coated beads remained tip-bound and underwent assembly- and disassembly-driven movement over ≈3 $\mu$m, comparable to chromosome displacements in vivo. Dam1-based attachments to assembling tips were robust, supporting 0.5-3 pN of tension applied with a feedback-controlled optical trap as the MTs lengthened ≈1 $\mu$m. The attachments also harnessed energy from MT disassembly to generate movement against tension. Reversing the direction of force (i.e., switching to compressive force) caused the attachments to disengage the tip and slide over the filament, but sliding was blocked by areas where the MT was anchored to a coverslip, consistent with a coupling structure encircling the filament. Our findings demonstrate how the Dam1 complex may contribute directly to MT-driven chromosome movement. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

The Schizosaccharomyces pombe homolog of Survivin, Bir1p, is essential for chromosome condensation and spindle elongation and integrity. Bir1p, a nuclear protein, resides at the kinetochores in metaphase and anaphase A and spreads to the spindle mid-zone in anaphase B. Here we show that this relocation requires Cdk (Cyclin dependent kinase) inactivation and intact microtubules. With the aid of a kinesin mutant, klp5$\Delta$, we also show that completion of anaphase A is vital for effecting Bir1p re-location to the spindle mid-zone. Although minimal exchange of Bir1p sub-units occurs between the spindle and the nucleoplasm, the protein redistributes laterally within the mid-zone region. Bir1p dynamics therefore significantly differs from that of tubulin on an anaphase B spindle, which is loaded at the plus ends of growing microtubules and shows no lateral redistribution within the spindle. Thus, Bir1p, and possibly its associated proteins, might organize a dynamic mid-zone region that helps spindle elongation and maintenance. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Molecular Biology Society of Japan/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {During cell division, the mitotic kinesin-5 Eg5 generates most of the force required to separate centrosomes during spindle assembly. However, Kif15, another mitotic kinesin, can replace Eg5 function, permitting mammalian cells to acquire resistance to Eg5 poisons. Unlike Eg5, the mechanism by which Kif15 generates centrosome separation forces is unknown. Here we investigated the mechanical properties and force generation capacity of Kif15 at the single-molecule level using optical tweezers. We found that the non-motor microtubule-binding tail domain interacts with the microtubule's E-hook tail with a rupture force higher than the stall force of the motor. This allows Kif15 dimers to productively and efficiently generate forces that could potentially slide microtubules apart. Using an in vitro optical trapping and fluorescence assay, we found that Kif15 slides anti-parallel microtubules apart with gradual force buildup while parallel microtubule bundles remain stationary with a small amount of antagonizing force generated. A stochastic simulation shows the essential role of Kif15's tail domain for load storage within the Kif15-microtubule system. These results suggest a mechanism for how Kif15 rescues bipolar spindle assembly. Reinemann et al. investigate the mechanical properties and force generation capabilities of the mitotic kinesin Kif15 using optical tweezers. Measurements of motor subdomains, single motors, and motor-microtubule bundles paired with stochastic simulations reveal a mechanism for how Kif15 can rescue bipolar spindle assembly upon Eg5 inhibition.},

A. {\&} Higuchi, H. (2000) Nature (London) 406, 913-916): the filaments keep a given velocity for a while and then suddenly move in the opposite direction with similar velocity. We show that these observations nicely illustrate the concept of dynamic transitions in motor collections introduced earlier in the case of an infinite number of motors. We investigate the experimentally relevant case of a finite number of motors both when directionality is present (kinesins, myosins, Ncd) and absent (NK11). Using a symmetric two-state model, we demonstrate that bidirectional motion is the signature of a dynamic transition that results from the collective behavior of many motors acting on the same filament. For motors exhibiting directional bias individually, an asymmetric two-state model is appropriate. In that case, dynamic transitions exist for motor collections in the presence of an external force. We give predictions for the dependence of motion on ATP concentration, external forces, and the number of motors involved. In particular, we show that the reversal time grows exponentially with the number of motors per filament.},

The bipolar organization of spindles is essential for proper segregation of chromosomes, and requires plus-end-directed homotetrameric motor proteins of the widely conserved kinesin-5 (BimC) family. Hypotheses for bipolar spindle formation include the 'push-pull mitotic muscle' model, in which kinesin-5 and opposing motor proteins act between overlapping microtubules. However, the precise roles of kinesin-5 during this process are unknown. Here we show that the vertebrate kinesin-5 Eg5 drives the sliding of microtubules depending on their relative orientation. We found in controlled in vitro assays that Eg5 has the remarkable capability of simultaneously moving at ∼20 nm s-1 towards the plus-ends of each of the two microtubales it crosslinks. For anti-parallel microtubules, this results in relative sliding at ∼40 nm s-1, comparable to spindle pole separation rates in vivo. Furthermore, we found that Eg5 can tether microtubule plus-ends, suggesting an additional microtubule-binding mode for Eg5. Our results demonstrate how members of the kinesin-5 family are likely to function in mitosis, pushing apart interpolar microtubules as well as recruiting microtubules into bundles that are subsequently polarized by relative sliding.},

Kip3 is a multifunctional motor protein with microtubule depolymerase, plus-end motility, and antiparallel sliding activities. Here we demonstrate that the depolymerase activity is indispensable to control spindle length, whereas the motility and sliding activities are not sufficient. Furthermore, the microtubule-destabilizing activity is required to counteract Stu2/XMAP215-mediated microtubule polymerization so that spindle elongation terminates once spindles reach the appropriate final length. Our data support a model where Kip3 directly suppresses spindle microtubule polymerization, limiting midzone length. As a result, sliding forces within the midzone cannot buckle spindle microtubules, which allows the cell boundary to define the extent of spindle elongation.},

abstract = {Capillary morphogenesis protein-2 (CMG2) functions as an anthrax toxin receptor that plays an essential role in anthrax pathogenesis. Although mutations in CMG2 have been identified to cause two human autosomal recessive disorders, Juvenile Hyaline Fibromatosis and Infantile Systemic Hyalinosis, both characterized by excess hyaline material deposition in connective tissues, the physiologic function of CMG2 remains elusive. To study the roles of CMG2 in normal physiology, here we performed detailed histological analyses of the CMG2-null mice we generated previously. While no morphological or histological defects were observed in CMG2(-/-) male mice, CMG2(-/-) female mice were unable to produce any offspring due to a defect in parturition. We found that deletion of CMG2 resulted in a diffuse deposition of collagen within the myometrium of CMG2(-/-) females, causing remarkable morphological changes to their uteri. This collagen accumulation also led to loss of smooth muscle cells in the myometrium of CMG2(-/-) mice, apparently disabling uterine contractile function during parturition. As a consequence, even though pregnant CMG2(-/-) mice were able to carry the gestation to full term, they were unable to deliver pups. However, the fully-developed fetuses could be successfully delivered by Cesarean section and survived to adulthood when fostered. Our results demonstrate that CMG2 is not required for normal mouse embryonic development but is indispensable for murine parturition. In parallel to its role in anthrax toxin binding and internalization, herein we provide evidence that CMG2 may function as a collagen receptor which is essential for maintaining collagen homeostasis in the uterus.},

abstract = {In animal and yeast cells, the mitotic spindle is aligned perpendicularly to the axis of cell division. This ensures that sister chromatids are separated to opposite sides of the cytokinetic actomyosin ring. In fission yeast, spindle rotation is dependent upon the interaction of astral microtubules with the cortical actin cytoskeleton. In this article, we show that addition of Latrunculin A, which prevents spindle rotation, delays the separation of sister chromatids and anaphase promoting complex-mediated destruction of spindle-associated Securin and Cyclin B. Moreover, we find that whereas sister kinetochore pairs normally congress to the spindle midzone before anaphase onset, this congression is disrupted when astral microtubule contact with the actin cytoskeleton is disturbed. By analyzing the timing of kinetochore separation, we find that this anaphase delay requires the Bub3, Mad3, and Bub1 but not the Mad1 or Mad2 spindle assembly checkpoint proteins. In agreement with this, we find that Bub1 remains associated with kinetochores when spindles are mispositioned. These data indicate that, in fission yeast, astral microtubule contact with the medial cell cortex is monitored by a subset of spindle assembly checkpoint proteins. We propose that this checkpoint ensures spindles are properly oriented before anaphase takes place.},

Although they are highly rigid polymers with a persistence length of 1-8 mm, they may exhibit a curved shape at a scale of few micrometers within cells, depending on their biological functions. However, how MT flexural rigidity in cells is regulated remains poorly understood. Here we ask whether MT-associated proteins (MAPs) could locally control the mechanical properties of MTs. We show that two major cross-linkers of the conserved MAP65/PRC1/Ase1 family drastically decrease MT rigidity. Their MT-binding domain mediates this effect. Remarkably, the softening effect of MAP65 observed on single MTs is maintained when MTs are cross-linked. By reconstituting physical collisions between growing MTs/MT bundles, we further show that the decrease in MT stiffness induced by MAP65 proteins is responsible for the sharp bending deformations observed in cells when they coalign at a steep angle to create bundles. Taken together, these data provide new insights into how MAP65, by modifying MT mechanical properties, may regulate the formation of complex MT arrays.},

In the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the mitotic spindle is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the rod-shaped cell. Here, using wild-type and cell-shape mutants we investigate the mechanism of initial spindle alignment and show that attachment of interphase microtubules to the spindle pole bodies (SPB), the yeast equivalent of the centrosome, is required to align duplicated SPBs, and thus the mitotic spindle, with the long axis of the cell. In the absence of interphase microtubules or attachment between the microtubules and the SPB, newly formed spindles are randomly oriented. We show that the axis of the mitotic spindle correlates with the axis along which the SPB, as a consequence of interphase microtubule dynamics, oscillates just before mitosis. We propose that cell geometry guides cytoplasmic microtubule alignment, which in turn, determines initial spindle alignment, and demonstrate that a failure of the spindle pre-alignment mechanism results in unequal chromosome segregation when spindle length is reduced.},

Protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (PRC1) is involved in cytokinesis and plays key roles in microtubule organization in eukaryotes. This study was aimed to analyse the expression and to investigate the functional role of PRC1 in gastric tumorigenesis. The expression of PRC1 was evaluated by qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The biological function of PRC1 was determined by CCK-8 proliferation assays, monolayer colony formation, xenografted nude mice and cell invasion assays by shRNA-mediated knockdown in AGS and HGC27 cells. The regulation of PRC1 expression by piperlongumine was also investigated using dual-luciferase reporter assay and ChIP-qPCR analysis. PRC1 was up-regulated in primary gastric cancers. Overexpression of PRC1 in gastric cancers was associated with poor disease-specific survival and overall survival. PRC1 knockdown in AGS and HGC27 cell lines suppressed proliferation, reduced monolayer colony formation, inhibited cell invasion and migration ability and induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Inhibition of PRC1 also suppressed tumour growth in vivo. We finally confirmed that PRC1 is a novel downstream target of piperlongumine in gastric cancer. Our findings supported the oncogenic role of PRC1 in gastric carcinogenesis. PRC1 might serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for gastric carcinoma.},

In normal mouse tissues the gene is expressed in the embryonic neural tube, suggesting a developmental function, while in Drosophila the homolog of int-1 is the segment polarity gene wingless. In order to study the protein products of int-1 we have derived fibroblast cell lines infected with multiple copies of a retroviral vector expressing int-1 cDNA. By Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation we have identified a 44 kd form of int-1 protein which is secreted from these cells. The 44 kd species is distinct from the major intracellular forms of int-1 protein as judged by its slower mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and by its longer half-life in pulse-chase experiments. Under normal growth conditions, little or none of the 44 kd protein is detectable in the cell culture medium but instead the majority is found associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM). The protein appears to bind heparin in vitro, suggesting that it might bind glycosaminoglycans in the ECM. These data support the view that int-1 protein may play a role in cell-cell communication over short distances.},

abstract = {An organised spindle is crucial to the fidelity of chromosome segregation, but the relationship between spindle structure and function is not well understood in any cell type. The anaphase B spindle in fission yeast has a slender morphology and must elongate against compressive forces. This 'pushing' mode of chromosome transport renders the spindle susceptible to breakage, as observed in cells with a variety of defects. Here we perform electron tomographic analyses of the spindle, which suggest that it organises a limited supply of structural components to increase its compressive strength. Structural integrity is maintained throughout the spindle's four-fold elongation by organising microtubules into a rigid transverse array, preserving correct microtubule number and dynamically rescaling microtubule length.},
annote = {They worked with fission yeast, I should be really understanding the main differences.

For the flashtalk:

1. Why the system
1.1 rate of elongation and timing of mitotic stage are consistent in different cells
1.2 It is because of this that we can relate the dynamics of mitosis to the reconstruction from EM
1.3 We know it is mediated by plus end directed molecular motors located in the centre, and MTs are bound to spindle pole body
1.4 The forces to which it is subjected have a well defined directionality, as revealed by severance experiments that show tthat elongation is powered by internal forces, and resisted by external compressive loads -{\textgreater} Example?


2. Method
- Brief tomography
- Track and straighten
3. Conclusions of the article

-Different packing regions

-Polymerization increases until metaphase, then the amount of F-tubulin remains constant, observed also in live-imaging

-This live cell imaging also confirms a very sterotypic spindle elongation profile

- A square lattice results in the tubules being further from the axis of the beam, and therefore to be harder to bend. Also the crosslinkers are longer in the middle. Cross-linkers are parallel in the extremes and antiparallel in the middle

-Dependency of L4 - Beam theory, and conservation of polymer mass (longer is thinner)

-First a thick spindle would be required, since the forces that the spindle exerts can be required for remodelloing the nuclear membrane (push it apart?) and to separate the sister chromatids

-Very small deviation from the theoretical values of the highest resistance

-The force that the spindle can take is enough to separate the nuclei (viscous drag), the force is comparable to the one exerted by two kinesins. This seems to be inefficient to separate lagging chromosomes or concatenated chromosomes. The lateral reinforcement possibility brings into play 
4. Perspectives

-Why this elongated shape rather than elipsoid? Maybe since yeast cells have the cell wall they need less support from cytoskeletton and therefore have less actin and tubulin. This structures are 1000 times smaller than the ones found in metazoans},

abstract = {Mitotic spindle assembly requires the combined activity of various molecular motor proteins, including Eg5 [1] and dynein [2]. Together, these motors generate antagonistic forces during mammalian bipolar spindle assembly [3]; what remains unknown, however, is how these motors are functionally coordinated such that antagonism is possible. Given that Eg5 generates an outward force by crosslinking and sliding apart antiparallel microtubules (MTs) [4-6], we explored the possibility that dynein generates an inward force by likewise sliding antiparallel MTs. We reasoned that antiparallel overlap, and therefore the magnitude of??a dynein-mediated force, would be inversely proportional to the initial distance between centrosomes. To capitalize on this relationship, we utilized a nocodazole washout assay to mimic spindle assembly. We found that Eg5 inhibition led to either monopolar or bipolar spindle formation, depending on whether centrosomes were initially separated by less than or greater than 5.5 ??m, respectively. Mathematical modeling predicted this same spindle bistability in the absence of functional Eg5 and required dynein acting on antiparallel MTs to do so. Our results suggest that dynein functionally coordinates with Eg5 by crosslinking and sliding antiparallel MTs, a novel role for dynein within the framework of spindle assembly. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

How polyploid cells deal with increased centrosome numbers and DNA content remains unknown. Using Drosophila neuroblasts and human cancer cells to study mitotic spindle assembly in polyploid cells, we found that most polyploid cells divide in a multipolar manner. We show that even if an initial centrosome clustering step can occur at mitotic entry, the establishment of kinetochore-microtubule attachments leads to spatial chromosome configurations, whereby the final coalescence of supernumerary poles into a bipolar array is inhibited. Using in silico approaches and various spindle and DNA perturbations, we show that chromosomes act as a physical barrier blocking spindle pole coalescence and bipolarity. Importantly, microtubule stabilization suppressed multipolarity by improving both centrosome clustering and pole coalescence. This work identifies inhibitors of bipolar division in polyploid cells and provides a rationale to understand chromosome instability typical of polyploid cancer cells.},

Although individual +TIPs have been studied in depth and we understand their basic contributions to microtubule dynamics, there is a growing body of evidence that these proteins exhibit cross-talk and likely function to collectively integrate microtubule behavior and upstream signaling pathways. In this study, we have identified a novel protein-protein interaction between the XMAP215 homologue in Drosophila, Mini spindles (Msps), and the CLASP homologue, Orbit. These proteins have been shown to promote and suppress microtubule dynamics, respectively. We show that microtubule dynamics are regionally controlled in cells by Rac acting to suppress GSK3$\beta$ in the peripheral lamellae/lamellipodium. Phosphorylation of Orbit by GSK3$\beta$ triggers a relocalization of Msps from the microtubule plus end to the lattice. Mutation of the Msps-Orbit binding site revealed that this interaction is required for regulating microtubule dynamic instability in the cell periphery. Based on our findings, we propose that Msps is a novel Rac effector that acts, in partnership with Orbit, to regionally regulate microtubule dynamics.},

We show that the cooperative attachment and detachment of cortical force generators to astral microtubules leads to spontaneous oscillations beyond a critical number of force generators. This mechanism can quantitatively describe the spindle oscillations observed during unequal division of the one cell stage Caenorhabditis elegans embryo.},

abstract = {Kinesin-5 motors fulfil essential roles in mitotic spindle morphogenesis and dynamics as slow, processive microtubule (MT) plus-end directed motors. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinesin-5 Cin8 was found, surprisingly, to switch directionality. Here, we have examined directionality using single-molecule fluorescence motility assays and live-cell microscopy. On spindles, Cin8 motors mostly moved slowly (∼25 nm/s) towards the midzone, but occasionally also faster (∼55 nm/s) towards the spindle poles. In vitro, individual Cin8 motors could be switched by ionic conditions from rapid (380 nm/s) and processive minus-end to slow plus-end motion on single MTs. At high ionic strength, Cin8 motors rapidly alternated directionalities between antiparallel MTs, while driving steady plus-end relative sliding. Between parallel MTs, plus-end motion was only occasionally observed. Deletion of the uniquely large insert in loop 8 of Cin8 induced bias towards minus-end motility and affected the ionic strength-dependent directional switching of Cin8 in vitro. The deletion mutant cells exhibited reduced midzone-directed motility and efficiency to support spindle elongation, indicating the importance of directionality control for the anaphase function of Cin8.},

abstract = {The primary olfactory sensory system is part of the PNS that develops from ectodermal placodes. Several cell types, including sensory neurons and support cells, differentiate within the olfactory placode to form the mature olfactory organ. The olfactory placodes are thought to arise from lateral regions of the anterior neural plate, which separate from the plate through differential cell movements. We determined the origins of the olfactory placodes in zebrafish by labeling cells along the anterior-lateral edge of the neural plate at times preceding the formation of the olfactory placodes and examining the later fates of the labeled cells. Surprisingly, we found that the olfactory placode arises from a field of cells, not from a discrete region of the anterior neural plate. This field extends posteriorly to the anterior limits of cranial neural crest and is bordered medially by telencephalic precursors. Cells giving rise to progeny in both the olfactory organ and telencephalon express the distal-less 3 gene. Furthermore, we found no localized pockets of cell division in the anterior-lateral neural plate cells preceding the appearance of the olfactory placode. We suggest that the olfactory placodes arise by anterior convergence of a field of lateral neural plate cells, rather than by localized separation and proliferation of a discrete group of cells.},

abstract = {During asymmetric division, fate determinants at the cell cortex segregate unequally into the two daughter cells. It has recently been shown that Sara (Smad anchor for receptor activation) signalling endosomes in the cytoplasm also segregate asymmetrically during asymmetric division. Biased dispatch of Sara endosomes mediates asymmetric Notch/Delta signalling during the asymmetric division of sensory organ precursors in Drosophila. In flies, this has been generalized to stem cells in the gut and the central nervous system, and, in zebrafish, to neural precursors of the spinal cord. However, the mechanism of asymmetric endosome segregation is not understood. Here we show that the plus-end kinesin motor Klp98A targets Sara endosomes to the central spindle, where they move bidirectionally on an antiparallel array of microtubules. The microtubule depolymerizing kinesin Klp10A and its antagonist Patronin generate central spindle asymmetry. This asymmetric spindle, in turn, polarizes endosome motility, ultimately causing asymmetric endosome dispatch into one daughter cell. We demonstrate this mechanism by inverting the polarity of the central spindle by polar targeting of Patronin using nanobodies (single-domain antibodies). This spindle inversion targets the endosomes to the wrong cell. Our data uncover the molecular and physical mechanism by which organelles localized away from the cellular cortex can be dispatched asymmetrically during asymmetric division. },

Recent structural work has shed light on the mechanism of $\gamma$TuRC-based microtubule nucleation, confirming the long-standing hypothesis that the $\gamma$TuRC functions as a microtubule template. The first crystallographic analysis of a non-$\gamma$-tubulin $\gamma$TuRC component ($\gamma$-tubulin complex protein 4 (GCP4)) has resulted in a new appreciation of the relationships among all $\gamma$TuRC proteins, leading to a refined model of their organization and function. The structures have also suggested an unexpected mechanism for regulating $\gamma$TuRC activity via conformational modulation of the complex component GCP3. New experiments on $\gamma$TuRC localization extend these insights, suggesting a direct link between its attachment at specific cellular sites and its activation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The essential functions required for mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome biorientation and segregation are not fully understood, despite extensive study. To illuminate the combinations of ingredients most important to align and segregate chromosomes and simultaneously assemble a bipolar spindle, we developed a computational model of fission-yeast mitosis. Robust chromosome biorientation requires progressive restriction of attachment geometry, destabilization of misaligned attachments, and attachment force dependence. Large spindle length fluctuations can occur when the kinetochore-microtubule attachment lifetime is long. The primary spindle force generators are kinesin-5 motors and crosslinkers in early mitosis, while interkinetochore stretch becomes important after biorientation. The same mechanisms that contribute to persistent biorientation lead to segregation of chromosomes to the poles after anaphase onset. This model therefore provides a framework to interrogate key requirements for robust chromosome biorientation, spindle length regulation, and force generation in the spindle.},

abstract = {The von Willebrand A (VWA) domain is a well-studied domain involved in cell adhesion, in extracellular matrix proteins, and in integrin receptors. A number of human diseases arise from mutations in VWA domains. We have analyzed the phylogenetic distribution of this domain and the relationships among approximately 500 proteins containing this domain. Although the majority of VWA-containing proteins are extracellular, the most ancient ones, present in all eukaryotes, are all intracellular proteins involved in functions such as transcription, DNA repair, ribosomal and membrane transport, and the proteasome. A common feature seems to be involvement in multiprotein complexes. Subsequent evolution involved deployment of VWA domains by Metazoa in extracellular proteins involved in cell adhesion such as integrin beta subunits (all Metazoa). Nematodes and chordates separately expanded their complements of extracellular matrix proteins containing VWA domains, whereas plants expanded their intracellular complement. Chordates developed VWA-containing integrin alpha subunits, collagens, and other extracellular matrix proteins (e.g., matrilins, cochlin/vitrin, and von Willebrand factor). Consideration of the known properties of VWA domains in integrins and extracellular matrix proteins allows insights into their involvement in protein-protein interactions and the roles of bound divalent cations and conformational changes. These allow inferences about similar functions in novel situations such as protease regulators (e.g., complement factors and trypsin inhibitors) and intracellular proteins (e.g., helicases, chelatases, and copines).},

Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are embedded in the NE to facilitate transport of proteins and other macromolecules into and out of the nucleus. In fungi and early embryos where the NE does not completely breakdown during mitosis, microtubule-organizing centers such as the spindle pole body (SPB) must also be inserted into the NE to facilitate organization of the mitotic spindle. Several recent papers have shed light on the mechanism by which SPB complexes are inserted into the NE. An unexpected link between the SPB and NPCs suggests that assembly of these NE complexes is tightly coordinated.

The mast gene product is evolutionarily conserved since homologues were identified from yeast to man, revealing a navel protein family. Antibodies against Mast and analysis of tissue culture cells expressing an enhanced green fluorescent protein-Mast fusion protein show that during mitosis, this protein localizes to centrosomes, the mitotic spindle, centromeres and spindle midzone. Microtubule-binding assays indicate that Mast is a microtubule-associated protein displaying strong affinity for polymerized microtubules. The defects observed in the mutant alleles and the intracellular localization of the protein suggest that Mast plays an essential role in centrosome separation and organization of the bipolar mitotic spindle.},

Fission yeast Alp14, a newly identified TOG/XMAP215 family protein, is essential for proper chromosome segregation in concert with a second homologue Dis1. We show that the alp14 mutant fails to progress towards normal bipolar spindle formation. Intriguingly, Alp14 itself is a component of the Mad2-dependent spindle checkpoint cascade, as upon addition of microtubule-destabilizing drugs the alp14 mutant is incapable of maintaining high H1 kinase activity, which results in securin destruction and premature chromosome separation. Live imaging of Alp14-green fluorescent protein shows that during mitosis, Alp14 is associated with the peripheral region of the kinetochores as well as with the spindle poles. This is supported by ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) and overlapping localization with the kinetochore marker Mis6. An intact spindle is required for Alp14 localization to the kinetochore periphery, but not to the poles. These results indicate that the TOG/XMAP215 family may play a central role as a bridge between the kinetochores and the plus end of pole to chromosome microtubules.},

The method is a compact, computer-oriented, Monte Carlo simulation procedure. It should be particularly useful for modeling the transient behavior of well-mixed gas-phase systems in which many molecular species participate in many highly coupled chemical reactions. For “ordinary” chemical systems in which fluctuations and correlations play no significant role, the method stands as an alternative to the traditional procedure of numerically solving the deterministic reaction rate equations. For nonlinear systems near chemical instabilities, where fluctuations and correlations may invalidate the deterministic equations, the method constitutes an efficient way of numerically examining the predictions of the stochastic master equation. Although fully equivalent to the spatially homogeneous master equation, the numerical simulation algorithm presented here is more directly based on a newly defined entity called “the reaction probability density function.” The purpose of this article is to describe the mechanics of the simulation algorithm, and to establish in a rigorous, a priori manner its physical and mathematical validity; numerical applications to specific chemical systems will be presented in subsequent publications.},

Consistent with this, cytoplasmic microtubules are often highly curved and appear buckled because of compressive loads. However, the results of in vitro studies suggest that microtubules should buckle at much larger length scales, withstanding only exceedingly small compressive forces. This discrepancy calls into question the structural role of microtubules, and highlights our lack of quantitative knowledge of the magnitude of the forces they experience and can withstand in living cells. We show that intracellular microtubules do bear large-scale compressive loads from a variety of physiological forces, but their buckling wavelength is reduced significantly because of mechanical coupling to the surrounding elastic cytoskeleton. We quantitatively explain this behavior, and show that this coupling dramatically increases the compressive forces that microtubules can sustain, suggesting they can make a more significant structural contribution to the mechanical behavior of the cell than previously thought possible.},

abstract = {The microtubule-associated protein TOGp, which belongs to a widely distributed protein family from yeasts to humans, is highly expressed in human tumors and brain tissue. From purified components we have determined the effect of TOGp on thermally induced tubulin association in vitro in the presence of 1 mM GTP and 3.4 M glycerol. Physicochemical parameters describing the mechanism of tubulin polymerization were deduced from the kinetic curves by application of the classical theoretical models of tubulin assembly. We have calculated from the polymerization time curves a range of parameters characteristic of nucleation, elongation, or steady state phase. In addition, the tubulin subunits turnover at microtubule ends was deduced from tubulin GTPase activity. For comparison, parallel experiments were conducted with colchicine and taxol, two drugs active on microtubules and with tau, a structural microtubule-associated protein from brain tissue. TOGp, which decreases the nucleus size and the tenth time of the reaction (the time required to produce 10{\%} of the final amount of polymer), shortens the nucleation phase of microtubule assembly. In addition, TOGp favors microtubule formation by increasing the apparent first order rate constant of elongation. Moreover, TOGp increases the total amount of polymer by decreasing the tubulin critical concentration and by inhibiting depolymerization during the steady state of the reaction. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) and infantile systemic hyalinosis (ISH) are autosomal recessive syndromes of unknown etiology characterized by multiple, recurring subcutaneous tumors, gingival hypertrophy, joint contractures, osteolysis, and osteoporosis. Both are believed to be allelic disorders; ISH is distinguished from JHF by its more severe phenotype, which includes hyaline deposits in multiple organs, recurrent infections, and death within the first 2 years of life. Using the previously reported chromosome 4q21 JHF disease locus as a guide for candidate-gene identification, we identified and characterized JHF and ISH disease-causing mutations in the capillary morphogenesis factor-2 gene (CMG2). Although CMG2 encodes a protein upregulated in endothelial cells during capillary formation and was recently shown to function as an anthrax-toxin receptor, its physiologic role is unclear. Two ISH family-specific truncating mutations, E220X and the 1-bp insertion P357insC that results in translation of an out-of-frame stop codon, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and were shown to delete the CMG-2 transmembrane and/or cytosolic domains, respectively. An ISH compound mutation, I189T, is predicted to create a novel and destabilizing internal cavity within the protein. The JHF family-specific homoallelic missense mutation G105D destabilizes a von Willebrand factor A extracellular domain alpha-helix, whereas the other mutation, L329R, occurs within the transmembrane domain of the protein. Finally, and possibly providing insight into the pathophysiology of these diseases, analysis of fibroblasts derived from patients with JHF or ISH suggests that CMG2 mutations abrogate normal cell interactions with the extracellular matrix.},

abstract = {Molecular motors are required for spindle assembly and maintenance during cell division. How motors move and interact inside spindles is unknown. Using photoactivation and photobleaching, we measure mitotic motor movement inside a dynamic spindle. We find that dynein-dynactin transports the essential motor Eg5 toward the spindle poles in Xenopus laevis egg extract spindles, revealing a direct interplay between two motors of opposite directionality. This transport occurs throughout the spindle except at the very spindle center and at the spindle poles, where Eg5 remains stationary. The variation of Eg5 dynamics with its position in the spindle is indicative of position-dependent functions of this motor protein. Our results suggest that Eg5 drives microtubule flux by antiparallel microtubule sliding in the spindle center, whereas the dynein-dependent concentration of Eg5 outside the spindle center could contribute to parallel microtubule cross-linking. These results emphasize the importance of spatially differentiated functions of motor proteins and contribute to our understanding of spindle organization. {\textcopyright} 2008 Uteng et al.},

abstract = {Spindles are arrays of microtubules that segregate chromosomes during cell division. It has been difficult to validate models of spindle assembly due to a lack of information on the organization of microtubules in these structures. Here we present a method, based on femtosecond laser ablation, capable of measuring the detailed architecture of spindles. We used this method to study the metaphase spindle in Xenopus laevis egg extracts and found that microtubules are shortest near poles and become progressively longer toward the center of the spindle. These data, in combination with mathematical modeling, imaging, and biochemical perturbations, are sufficient to reject previously proposed mechanisms of spindle assembly. Our results support a model of spindle assembly in which microtubule polymerization dynamics are not spatially regulated, and the proper organization of microtubules in the spindle is determined by nonuniform microtubule nucleation and the local sorting of microtubules by transport.},
annote = {They cut with laser and look at the depolymerization wave.

With this for a start they can see the orientation of microtubules at any point, by seeing how big the wave of depol is in one side vs. other (Fig.2 B), basically when you cut in the center, both sides show the same depol. front, while when you cut on the side, most of the microtubules are pointing towards the center.

The decay of depol. wave is indicative of reaching minus ends, so with this they can measure where minus ends are.

To measure the distribution of plus ends, they do a trick with two cuts, microtubules that depolymerised from one of the cuts only had their plus ends between the two cuts.

Microtubule lengths are exponentially distributed along the whole spindle, but the mean length is higher at the center: pole 2.5 um, center 13.7 um

They conclude this results from higher nucleation at the center, and then transport towards the pole (microtubules at the pole are just older)

They saw no stabilization of microtubules in the spindle environement

How come the peak of plus ends is towards the left of the spindle?},

abstract = {During cell division, microtubules in the mitotic spindle form antiparallel overlaps near the center of the spindle. Kinesin motor proteins alter microtubule polymerization dynamics to regulate the length of these overlaps to maintain spindle integrity. Length regulation of antiparallel overlaps has been reconstituted with purified microtubules, crosslinkers, and motors. Here we develop a theory of steady-state overlap length which depends on the filament plus-end motor concentration, determined by a balance between motor arrival (motor binding and stepping in the overlap) and motor departure (motor unbinding from filament tips during depolymerization) in the absence of motor-driven sliding. Assuming that motors processively depolymerize and exhibit altered binding kinetics near MT plus-ends improves the agreement between theory and experiment. Our theory explains the origin of the experimentally observed critical concentration, a minimum motor concentration to observe a steady-state overlap length.},

abstract = {Mitotic spindles of Schizosaccharomyces pombe have been studied by EM, using serial cross sections to reconstruct 12 spindles from cells that were ultrarapidly frozen and fixed by freeze substitution. The resulting distributions of microtubules (MTs) have been analyzed by computer. Short spindles contain two kinds of MTs: continuous ones that run from pole to pole and MTs that originate at one pole and end in the body of the spindle. Among the latter there are three pairs of MT bundles that end on fibrous, darkly staining structures that we interpret as kinetochores. The number of MTs ending at each putative kinetochore ranges from two to four; all kinetochore-associated MTs disappear as the spindle elongates from 3-6 microns. At this and greater spindle lengths, there are no continuous MTs, only polar MTs that interdigitate at the spindle midzone, but the spindle continues to elongate. An analysis of the density of neighboring MTs at the midzone of long spindles shows that their most common spacing is approximately 40 nm, center to center, and that there is a preferred angular separation of 90 degrees. Only hints of such square-packing are found at the midzone of short spindles, and near the poles there is no apparent order at any mitotic stage. Our data suggest that the kinetochore MTs (KMTs) do not interact directly with nonkinetochore MTs, but that interdigitating MTs from the two spindle poles do interact to form a mechanically stable bundle that connects the poles. As the spindle elongates, the number of MTs decreases while the mean length of the MTs that remain increases. We conclude that the chromosomes of S. pombe become attached to the spindle by kinetochore MTs, that these MTs disappear as the chromosomes segregate, that increased separation of daughter nuclei is accompanied by a sliding apart of anti-parallel MTs, and that the mitotic processes of S. pombe are much like those in other eukaryotic cells.},

abstract = {Kinesin and dynein are motor proteins that move in opposite directions along microtubules. In this study, we examine the consequences of having kinesin and dynein (ciliary outer arm or cytoplasmic) bound to glass surfaces interacting with the same microtubule in vitro. Although one might expect a balance of opposing forces to produce little or no net movement, we find instead that microtubules move unidirectionally for several microns (corresponding to hundreds of ATPase cycles by a motor) but continually switch between kinesin-directed and dynein-directed transport. The velocities in the plus-end (0.2-0.3 $\mu$m/s) and minusend (3.5-4 $\mu$m/s) directions were approximately half those produced by kinesin (0.5 $\mu$m/s) and ciliary dynein (6.7 $\mu$m/s) alone, indicating that the motors not contributing to movement can interact with and impose a drag upon the microtubule. By comparing two dyneins with different duty ratios (percentage of time spent in a strongly bound state during the ATPase cycle) and varying the nucleotide conditions, we show that the microtubule attachment times of the two opposing motors as well as their relative numbers determine which motor predominates in this assay. Together, these findings are consistent with a model in which kinesin-induced movement of a microtubule induces a negative strain in attached dyneins which causes them to dissociate before entering a force-generating state (and vice versa); reversals in the direction of transport may require the temporary dissociation of the transporting motor from the microtubule. The bidirectional movements described here are also remarkably similar to the back-and-forth movements of chromosomes during mitosis and membrane vesicles in fibroblasts. These results suggest that the underlying mechanical properties of motor proteins, at least in part, may be responsible for reversals in microtubule-based transport observed in cells.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}As cells transition from interphase to mitosis, the microtubule cytoskeleton is reorganized to form the mitotic spindle. In the closed mitosis of fission yeast, a microtubule-associated protein complex, Alp7–Alp14 (transforming acidic coiled-coil–tumor overexpressed gene), enters the nucleus upon mitotic entry and promotes spindle formation. However, how the complex is controlled to accumulate in the nucleus only during mitosis remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that Alp7–Alp14 is excluded from the nucleus during interphase using the nuclear export signal in Alp14 but is accumulated in the nucleus during mitosis through phosphorylation of Alp7 by the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). Five phosphorylation sites reside around the nuclear localization signal of Alp7, and the phosphodeficient alp7-5A mutant fails to accumulate in the nucleus during mitosis and exhibits partial spindle defects. Thus our results reveal one way that CDK regulates spindle assembly at mitotic entry: CDK phosphorylates the Alp7–Alp14 complex to localize it to the nucleus.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Odde1995,
abstract = {Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments whose self-assembly occurs by abrupt switching between states of roughly constant growth and shrinkage, a process known as dynamic instability. Understanding the mechanism of dynamic instability offers potential for controlling microtubule-dependent cellular processes such as nerve growth and mitosis. The growth to shrinkage transitions (catastrophes) and the reverse transitions (rescues) that characterize microtubule dynamic instability have been assumed to be random events with first-order kinetics. By direct observation of individual microtubules in vitro and probabilistic analysis of their distribution of growth times, we found that while the slower growing and biologically inactive (minus) ends obeyed first-order catastrophe kinetics, the faster growing and biologically active (plus) ends did not. The non-first-order kinetics at plus ends imply that growing microtubule plus ends have an effective frequency of catastrophe that depends on how long the microtubules have been growing. This frequency is low initially but then rises asymptotically to a limiting value. Our results also suggest that an additional parameter, beyond the four parameters typically used to describe dynamic instability, is needed to account for the observed behavior and that changing this parameter can significantly affect the distribution of microtubule lengths at steady state. {\textcopyright} 1995, The Biophysical Society.

abstract = {Although the mechanism of microtubule dynamic instability is thought to involve the hydrolysis of tubulin-bound GTP, the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis and the basis of microtubule stability are controversial. Video microscopy of individual microtubules and dilution protocols were used to examine the size and lifetime of the stabilizing cap. Purified porcine brain tubulin (7-23 $\mu$M) was assembled at 37°C onto both ends of isolated sea urchin axoneme fragments in a miniature flow cell to give a 10-fold variation in elongation rate. The tubulin concentration in the region of microtubule growth could be diluted rapidly (by 84{\%} within 3 s of the onset of dilution). Upon perfusion with buffer containing no tubulin, microtubules experienced a catastrophe (conversion from elongation to rapid shortening) within 4-6 s on average after dilution to 16{\%} of the initial concentration, independent of the predilution rate of elongation and length. Based on extrapolation of catastrophe frequency to zero tubulin concentration, the estimated lifetime of the stable cap after infinite dilution was {\textless}3-4 s for plus and minus ends, much shorter than the {\~{}}200 s observed at steady state (Walker, R. A., E. T. O'Brien, N. K. Pryer, M. Soboeiro, W. A. Voter, H. P. Erickson, and E. D. Salmon. 1988. J. Cell Biol. 107:1437-1448). We conclude that during elongation, both plus and minus ends are stabilized by a short region ({\~{}}200 dimers or less) and that the size of the stable cap is independent of 10-fold variation in elongation rate. These results eliminate models of dynamic instability which predict extensive ''build-up'' stabilizing caps and support models which constrain the cap to the elongating tip. We propose that the cell may take advantage of such an assembly mechanism by using ''catastrophe factors'' that can promote frequent catastrophe even at high elongation rates by transiently binding to microtubule ends and briefly inhibiting GTP-tubulin association.},

abstract = {Microtubule dynamic instability allows search and capture of kinetochores during spindle forma-tion, an important process for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. Recent work has found that microtubule rotational diffusion about minus-end attachment points contributes to kinetochore capture in fission yeast, but the relative contributions of dynamic instability and rotational diffusion are not well understood. We have developed a biophysical model of kinetochore capture in small fission-yeast nuclei using hybrid Brownian dynamics/kinetic Monte Carlo simu-lation techniques. With this model, we have studied the importance of dynamic instability and microtubule rotational diffusion for kinetochore capture, both to the lateral surface of a microtubule and at or near its end. Over a range of biologically relevant parameters, microtubule rotational diffusion decreased capture time, but made a relatively small contribution compared to dynamic instability. At most, rotational diffusion reduced capture time by 25{\%}. Our results suggest that while microtubule rotational diffusion can speed up kinetochore capture, it is unlikely to be the dominant physical mechanism. In addition, we found that when microtubules undergo dynamic instability, lateral captures predominate even in the absence of rotational diffusion. Counterintu-itively, adding rotational diffusion to a dynamic microtubule increases the probability of end-on capture.},

Most kinetochore-associated microtubule ends display curving "protofilaments," strands of tubulin dimers that bend away from the microtubule axis. Both a kinetochore "plate" and an encircling, ring-shaped protein complex have been proposed to link protofilament bending to poleward chromosome motion. Here we show by electron tomography that slender fibrils connect curved protofilaments directly to the inner kinetochore. Fibril-protofilament associations correlate with a local straightening of the flared protofilaments. Theoretical analysis reveals that protofilament-fibril connections would be efficient couplers for chromosome motion, and experimental work on two very different kinetochore components suggests that filamentous proteins can couple shortening microtubules to cargo movements. These analyses define a ring-independent mechanism for harnessing microtubule dynamics directly to chromosome movement. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

It is also the most common human fungal pathogen, causing a variety of skin and soft tissue infections in healthy people and more virulent invasive and disseminated diseases in patients with compromised immune systems. How this microorganism manages to persist in healthy hosts but also to cause a spectrum of disease states in the immunocompromised host are questions of significant biological interest as well as major clinical and economic importance. In this review, we describe recent developments in population genetics, the mating process, and gene disruption technology that are providing much needed experimental insights into the biology of C. albicans.

abstract = {Tub4p is a novel tubulin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that most closely resembles $\gamma$-tubulin. We report in this manuscript that the essential Tub4p is associated with the inner and outer plaques of the yeast microtubule organizing center, the spindle pole body (SPB). These SPB substructures are involved in the attachment of the nuclear and cytoplasmic microtubules, respectively (Byers, B., and L. Goetsch, 1975, J. Bacteriol. 124:511-523). Study of a temperature sensitive tub4-1 allele revealed that TUB4 has essential functions in microtubule organization. Remarkably, SPB duplication and separation are not impaired in tub4-1 cells incubated at the nonpermissive temperature. However, SPBs from such cells contain less or misdirected nuclear microtubules. Further analysis revealed that tub4-1 cells are able to assemble a short bipolar spindle, suggesting that the defect in microtubule organization occurs after spindle formation. A role of Tub4p in microtubule organization is further suggested by an increase in chromosome loss in tub4-1 cells. In addition, cell cycle arrest and survival of tub4-1 cells is dependent on the mitotic checkpoint control gene BUB2 (Hoyt, M.A., L. Totis, B.T. Roberts, 1991, Cell. 66:507-517), one of the cell's monitors of spindle integrity.},

We report that perturbing expression of Xenopus PCP genes, Strabismus (Xstbm), Frizzled (Xfz7), and Prickle (Xpk), disrupts radially polarized fibronectin fibril assembly on mesodermal tissue surfaces, mediolaterally polarized motility, and intercalation. Polarized motility is restored in Xpk-perturbed explants but not in Xstbm- or Xfz7-perturbed explants cultured on fibronectin surfaces. The PCP complex, including Xpk, first regulates polarized surface assembly of the fibronectin matrix, which is necessary for mediolaterally polarized motility, and then, without Xpk, has an additional and necessary function in polarizing motility. These results show that the PCP complex regulates several cell polarities (radial, planar) and several processes (matrix deposition, motility), by indirect and direct mechanisms, and acts in several modes, either with all or a subset of its components, during vertebrate morphogenesis.},

abstract = {Here we develop a minimal model of the cell actomyosin cortex by forming a quasi-2D cross-linked filamentous actin (F-actin) network adhered to a model cell membrane and contracted by myosin thick filaments. Myosin motors generate both compressive and tensile stresses on F-actin and consequently induce large bending fluctuations, which reduces their effective persistence length to {\textless}1 $\mu$m. Over a large range of conditions, we show the extent of network contraction corresponds exactly to the extent of individual F-actin shortening via buckling. This demonstrates an essential role of buckling in breaking the symmetry between tensile and compressive stresses to facilitate mesoscale network contraction of up to 80{\%} strain. Portions of buckled F-actin with a radius of curvature ∼300 nm are prone to severing and thus compressive stresses mechanically coordinate contractility with F-actin severing, the initial step of F-actin turnover. Finally, the F-actin curvature acquired by myosin-induced stresses can be further constrained by adhesion of the network to a membrane, accelerating filament severing but inhibiting the long-range transmission of the stresses necessary for network contractility. Thus, the extent of membrane adhesion can regulate the coupling between network contraction and F-actin severing. These data demonstrate the essential role of the nonlinear response of F-actin to compressive stresses in potentiating both myosin-mediated contractility and filament severing. This may serve as a general mechanism to mechanically coordinate contractility and cortical dynamics across diverse actomyosin assemblies in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells.},

abstract = {The kinesins-8 were originally thought to be microtubule depolymerases, but are now emerging as more versatile catalysts of microtubule dynamics. We show here that S. pombe Klp5-436 and Klp6-440 are non-processive plus-end-directed motors whose in vitro velocities on S. pombe microtubules at 7 and 23 nm s -1 are too slow to keep pace with the growing tips of dynamic interphase microtubules in living S. pombe. In vitro, Klp5 and 6 dimers exhibit a hitherto-undescribed combination of strong enhancement of microtubule nucleation with no effect on growth rate or catastrophe frequency. By contrast in vivo, both Klp5 and Klp6 promote microtubule catastrophe at cell ends whilst Klp6 also increases the number of interphase microtubule arrays (IMAs). Our data support a model in which Klp5/6 bind tightly to free tubulin heterodimers, strongly promoting the nucleation of new microtubules, and then continue to land as a tubulin-motor complex on the tips of growing microtubules, with the motors then dissociating after a few seconds residence on the lattice. In vivo, we predict that only at cell ends, when growing microtubule tips become lodged and their growth slows down, will Klp5/6 motor activity succeed in tracking growing microtubule tips. This mechanism would allow Klp5/6 to detect the arrival of microtubule tips at cells ends and to amplify the intrinsic tendency for microtubules to catastrophise in compression at cell ends. Our evidence identifies Klp5 and 6 as spatial regulators of microtubule dynamics that enhance both microtubule nucleation at the cell centre and microtubule catastrophe at the cell ends. {\textcopyright} 2012 Erent et al.},

Interestingly, non-kinetochore microtubules have been observed between sister kinetochores, but their function is unknown. Here we show by laser-cutting of a k-fibre in HeLa and PtK1 cells that a bundle of non-kinetochore microtubules, which we term 'bridging fibre', bridges sister k-fibres and balances the interkinetochore tension. We found PRC1 and EB3 in the bridging fibre, suggesting that it consists of antiparallel dynamic microtubules. By using a theoretical model that includes a bridging fibre, we show that the forces at the pole and at the kinetochore depend on the bridging fibre thickness. Moreover, our theory and experiments show larger relaxation of the interkinetochore distance for cuts closer to kinetochores. We conclude that the bridging fibre, by linking sister k-fibres, withstands the tension between sister kinetochores and enables the spindle to obtain a curved shape.},

While the crucial role played by active forces generated by motor proteins has been studied extensively, only recently the importance of passive forces exerted by non-enzymatic crosslinkers has been realized. The interplay between active and passive proteins manifests itself, e.g., during cell division, where the spindle structure formed by overlapping microtubules is subject to both active sliding forces generated by crosslinking motor proteins and passive forces exerted by passive crosslinkers, such as Ase1 and PRC1. We propose a minimal model to describe the stability behaviour of a pair of anti-parallel overlapping microtubules resulting from the competition between active motors and passive crosslinkers. We obtain the stability diagram which characterizes the formation of stable overlap of the MT pair, identify the controlling biological parameters which determine their stability, and study the impact of mutual interactions between motors and passive crosslinkers on the stability of these overlapping filaments.},

abstract = {Two successive rounds of chromosome segregation following a single round of DNA replication enable the production of haploid gametes during meiosis. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, karyogamy is the process where the nuclei from 2 haploid cells fuse to create a diploid nucleus, which then undergoes meiosis to produce 4 haploid spores. By screening a collection of S. pombe deletion strains, we found that the deletion of 2 genes, mal3 and mto1, leads to the production of asci containing up to 8 spores. Here, we show that Mal3, the fission yeast member of the EB1 family of conserved microtubule plus-end tracking proteins, is required for karyogamy, oscillatory nuclear movement, and proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. In the absence of Mal3, meiosis frequently initiates before the completion of karyogamy, thus producing up to 8 nuclei in a single ascus. Our results provide new evidence that fission yeast can initiate meiosis prior to completing karyogamy.},

abstract = {Chromosome segregation relies on the dynamic properties of spindle microtubules (MTs). Poleward MT flux contributes to spindle dynamics through the disassembly of MT minus ends at spindle poles coupled to the continuous poleward transport of spindle MTs [1, 2]. Despite being conserved in metazoan cells, the function of flux remains controversial because flux rates differ widely in different cell types. In meiotic systems, the rate of flux nearly matches that of chromosome movement [3-5], but in mitotic systems, flux is significantly slower than chromosome movement [6-8]. Here, we show that spindles in human mitotic cells depleted of the kinesin-13 proteins Kif2a and MCAK lack detectable flux and that such cells frequently fail to segregate all chromosomes appropriately at anaphase. Elimination of flux reduces poleward chromosome velocity ∼20{\%}, but does not hinder bipolar spindle assembly, chromosome alignment, or mitotic progression. Thus, mitosis proceeds efficiently in human cells lacking detectable poleward MT flux. These data demonstrate that in human cultured cells, kinetochores are sufficient to effectively power chromosome movement, leading us to speculate that flux is maintained in these cells to fulfill other functional roles such as error correction or kinetochore regulation. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

A key structural element for inter-head coordination is the neck linker (NL), which connects the heads to the stalk. To examine the role of the NL in regulating stepping, we investigated NL mutants of various lengths using single-molecule optical trapping and bulk fluorescence approaches in the context of a general framework for gating. Our results show that, although inter-head tension enhances motor velocity, it is crucial neither for inter-head coordination nor for rapid rear-head release. Furthermore, cysteine-light mutants do not produce wild-type motility under load. We conclude that kinesin-1 is primarily front-head gated, and that NL length is tuned to enhance unidirectional processivity and velocity.},

Here, we report that the modulation of MT dynamics by forces as observed in vitro can quantitatively explain the localization of MT catastrophes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. However, we found that it is necessary to add length-dependent catastrophe rates to make the model fully consistent with other previously measured traits of MTs. We explain the measured statistical distribution of MT-cortex contact times and re-examine the curling behavior of MTs in unbranched straight tea1Delta cells. Importantly, the model demonstrates that MTs together with associated proteins such as depolymerizing kinesins are, in principle, sufficient to mark the cell poles.},

abstract = { Candida auris has recently emerged as an important, multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen of humans. Comparative studies indicate that despite high levels of genetic divergence, C. auris is as virulent as the most pathogenic member of the genus, Candida albicans . However, key virulence attributes of C. albicans , such as morphogenetic switching, are not utilized by C. auris , indicating that this emerging pathogen employs alternative strategies to infect and colonize the host. An important trait required for the pathogenicity of many fungal pathogens is the ability to adapt to host-imposed stresses encountered during infection. Here, we investigated the relative resistance of C. auris and other pathogenic Candida species to physiologically relevant stresses and explored the role of the evolutionarily conserved Hog1 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) in promoting stress resistance and virulence. In comparison to C. albicans , C. auris is relatively resistant to hydrogen peroxide, cationic stress, and cell-wall-damaging agents. However, in contrast to other Candida species examined, C. auris  was unable to grow in an anaerobic environment and was acutely sensitive to organic oxidative-stress-inducing agents. An analysis of C. auris hog1 $\Delta$ cells revealed multiple roles for this SAPK in stress resistance, cell morphology, aggregation, and virulence. These data demonstrate that C. auris has a unique stress resistance profile compared to those of other pathogenic Candida species and that the Hog1 SAPK has pleiotropic roles that promote the virulence of this emerging pathogen.  IMPORTANCE The rapid global emergence and resistance of Candida auris to current antifungal drugs highlight the importance of understanding the virulence traits exploited by this human fungal pathogen to cause disease. Here, we characterize the stress resistance profile of C. auris and the role of the Hog1 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) in stress resistance and virulence. Our findings that C. auris is acutely sensitive to certain stresses may facilitate control measures to prevent persistent colonization in hospital settings. Furthermore, our observation that the Hog1 SAPK promotes C. auris virulence akin to that reported for many other pathogenic fungi indicates that antifungals targeting Hog1 signaling would be broad acting and effective, even on emerging drug-resistant pathogens. },

For those pathways downstream from the "canonical" Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, from the "non-canonical" or planar cell polarity (PCP), and from the Wnt-Ca(2+)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway, Wnt activation of its cellular receptor, a member of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptor Frizzled family, requires both heterotrimeric G proteins and the phosphoprotein Dishevelled. Our understanding of the roles of Dishevelled proteins in development is evolving and most recent observations suggest that Dishevelled proteins act as scaffolds essential for Wnt signaling, providing docking sites for a diverse and interesting set of protein kinases, phosphatases, adaptor proteins, G proteins, and other scaffolds such as Axin. The protein-protein interactions of Dishevelled are dynamic, as is the spatial localization of this "toolbox" of signaling molecules involved in development. Much excitement awaits the elucidation of the complete set of tools in the toolbox and of the dynamic regulation of Dishevelled proteins and their interacting proteins.},

The physical assumptions underlying this model are formalized using a continuum approximation resulting in a class of master-equation-like partial differential equations that is a generalization of a friction model due to Persson [Phys. Rev. B 51, 13568 (1995)] and is identical to the equations used to describe muscle contraction, first proposed by A. F. Huxley. We examine the properties of this friction model in the continuous binding site limit noting that this model is capable of producing both monotonically increasing and an increasing-decreasing force dependence on slip velocity. When monotonically increasing, the force dependence on velocity is (asymptotically) logarithmic. The model produces a transient increase in friction in response to a sudden velocity increase, whether or not the steady-state friction force is a decreasing or increasing function of steady slip velocity. The model also exhibits both stable steady slip and stick-slip-like oscillatory behavior, in the presence of compliance in the loading machine, even when the steady-state friction force is a decreasing function of steady-state slip velocity.},

abstract = {Dynamic instability, the stochastic switching between growth and shrinkage, is essential for microtubule function. This behavior is driven by GTP hydrolysis in the microtubule lattice and is inhibited by anticancer agents like Taxol. We provide insight into the mechanism of dynamic instability, based on high-resolution cryo-EM structures (4.7-5.6 {\AA}) of dynamic microtubules and microtubules stabilized by GMPCPP or Taxol. We infer that hydrolysis leads to a compaction around the E-site nucleotide at longitudinal interfaces, as well as movement of the $\alpha$-tubulin intermediate domain and H7 helix. Displacement of the C-terminal helices in both $\alpha$- and $\beta$-tubulin subunits suggests an effect on interactions with binding partners that contact this region. Taxol inhibits most of these conformational changes, allosterically inducing a GMPCPP-like state. Lateral interactions are similar in all conditions we examined, suggesting that microtubule lattice stability is primarily modulated at longitudinal interfaces. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In fission yeast, erroneous attachments of spindle microtubules to kinetochores are frequent in early mitosis. Most are corrected before anaphase onset by a mechanism involving the protein kinase Aurora B, which destabilizes kinetochore microtubules (ktMTs) in the absence of tension between sister chromatids. In this paper, we describe a minimal mathematical model of fission yeast chromosome segregation based on the stochastic attachment and detachment of ktMTs. The model accurately reproduces the timing of correct chromosome biorientation and segregation seen in fission yeast. Prevention of attachment defects requires both appropriate kinetochore orientation and an Aurora B-like activity. The model also reproduces abnormal chromosome segregation behavior (caused by, for example, inhibition of Aurora B). It predicts that, in metaphase, merotelic attachment is prevented by a kinetochore orientation effect and corrected by an Aurora B-like activity, whereas in anaphase, it is corrected through unbalanced forces applied to the kinetochore. These unbalanced forces are sufficient to prevent aneuploidy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Gay et al.},
annote = {Here perhaps the new thing is the addition of Aurora B effect in correction of merotelic attachments.

First of all the SAC is simulated as: You only go to anaphase if no kinetochore is unattached

They take a simplified version of Paul et al 2009. In Paul et al 2009, they say that when a single microtubule makes contact with a kinetochore which is in a chromosome with no attachments yet, it orients both kinetochores with the axis of the spindle, such that a microtubule making contact with the 'wrong' kinetochore is prevented, as it is 'hidden' behind the chromosome. In here they make a simplification and say that when one microtubule only is attached to a chrosome, there can be no errors. Somehow they say that biorientation makes it worse, i dont see how though.

The mechanism they propose for correction of merotelic is based on Aurora B activity being highest at the center of the kinetochore pair. Merotelic attachments will be at the center of the pairs so they will be most likely to be released.

The aurora detachment makes the detachment rate infinite at the center of the centromere and decays with 1/x},

In this study, we used meiotic egg extracts to gain insight into the role of the Xenopus laevis homologue Xorbit in spindle assembly and function. Xorbit immunodepletion or its inhibition by a dominant-negative fragment resulted in chromosome alignment defects and aberrant MT structures, including monopolar and small spindles. Xorbit-depleted extracts failed to nucleate MTs around chromatin-coated beads, indicating its essential requirement for spindle assembly in the absence of centrosomes and kinetochores. Xorbit's MT stabilizing effect was most apparent during anaphase, when spindle MTs depolymerized rapidly upon Xorbit inhibition. Biochemical interaction between a COOH-terminal Xorbit fragment and the kinetochore-associated kinesin centromeric protein E may contribute to Xorbit's role in chromosome congression. We propose that Xorbit tethers dynamic MT plus ends to kinetochores and chromatin, providing a stabilizing activity that is crucial for spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. {\textcopyright} The Rockefeller University Press.},

For these purposes, MT polymerisation dynamics are tightly regulated. Using automated image analysis software, we investigate the spatial dependence of MT dynamics in interphase fission yeast cells with unprecedented statistical accuracy. We find that MT catastrophe frequencies (switches from polymerisation to depolymerisation) strongly depend on intracellular position. We provide evidence that compressive forces generated by MTs growing against the cell pole locally reduce MT growth velocities and enhance catastrophe frequencies. Furthermore, we find evidence for an MT length-dependent increase in the catastrophe frequency that is mediated by kinesin-8 proteins (Klp5/6). Given the intrinsic susceptibility of MT dynamics to compressive forces and the widespread importance of kinesin-8 proteins, we propose that similar spatial regulation of MT dynamics plays a role in other cell types as well. In addition, our systematic and quantitative data should provide valuable input for (mathematical) models of MT organisation in living cells. {\textcopyright} 2009 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design' may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

Proper length control of the metaphase mitotic spindle is critical to this process and is thought to be achieved through a mechanism in which spindle pole separation forces from plus-end-directed motors are balanced by forces from minus-end-directed motors that pull spindle poles together. However, in contrast to this model, metaphase mitotic spindles with inactive kinesin-14minus-end-directed motors often have shorter spindle lengths, along with poorly aligned spindle microtubules. A mechanistic explanation for this paradox is unknown. Using computational modeling, invitro reconstitution, live-cell fluorescence microscopy, and electron microscopy, we now find that the budding yeast kinesin-14 molecular motor Kar3-Cik1 can efficiently align spindle microtubules along the spindle axis.

In this study, we investigated the function of Scp3 along with the effect of CIPC in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Microscopic observation revealed that treatment with CIPC, cps3-81 mutation and scp3+ gene deletion disturbed the orientation of microtubules in interphase cells. Overexpression of scp3+ suppressed the abnormal orientation of microtubules by promoting bundling. Functional analysis suggested that Scp3 functions independently from Ase1, a protein largely required for the bundling of the mitotic spindle. A strain lacking the ase1+ gene was more sensitive to CIPC, with the drug affecting the integrity of the mitotic spindle, indicating that CIPC has a mitotic target that has a role redundant with Ase1.

Here we show a new mechanism of directional signalling on the basis of the trafficking of Delta and Notch molecules already internalized in the SOP and subsequently targeted to the other daughter cell, pIIa. Internalized Delta and Notch traffic to an endosome marked by the protein Sara. During SOP mitosis, Sara endosomes containing Notch and Delta move to the central spindle and then to pIIa. Subsequently, in pIIa (but not in pIIb) Notch appears cleaved in Sara endosomes in a gamma-secretase- and Delta internalization-dependent manner, indicating that the release of the intracellular Notch tail to activate Notch target genes has occurred. We thus uncover a new mechanism to bias signalling even before asymmetric endocytosis of Sanpodo and Delta takes place in the daughter cells: already during SOP mitosis, asymmetric targeting of Delta and Notch-containing Sara endosomes will increase Notch signalling in pIIa and decrease it in pIIb.},

abstract = {Upon establishment of proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) must be silenced to allow onset of anaphase, which is when sister chromatids segregate equally to two daughter cells. However, how proper kinetochore- microtubule attachment leads to timely anaphase onset remains elusive. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms of chromosome movement during anaphase A remain unclear. In this study, we show that the fission yeast Alp7/TACC protein recruits a protein complex consisting of the kinesin-8 (Klp5-Klp6) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to the kinetochore upon kinetochore- microtubule attachment. Accumulation of this complex at the kinetochore, on the one hand, facilitates SAC inactivation through PP1, and, on the other hand, accelerates polewards chromosome movement driven by the Klp5-Klp6 motor. We identified an alp7 mutant that had specific defects in binding to the Klp5-Klp6-PP1 complex but with normal localisation to the microtubule and kinetochore. Consistent with our proposition, this mutant shows delayed anaphase onset and decelerated chromosome movement during anaphase A. We propose that the recruitment of kinesin-8-PP1 to the kinetochore through Alp7/TACC interaction plays a crucial role in regulation of timely mitotic progression and chromosome movement during anaphase A.},

abstract = {CLASPs are widely conserved microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins with essential roles in the local regulation of microtubule dynamics. In yeast, Drosophila, and Xenopus, a single CLASP orthologue is present, which is required for mitotic spindle assembly by regulating microtubule dynamics at the kinetochore. In mammals, however, only CLASP1 has been directly implicated in cell division, despite the existence of a second paralogue, CLASP2, whose mitotic roles remain unknown. Here, we show that CLASP2 localization at kinetochores, centrosomes, and spindle throughout mitosis is remarkably similar to CLASP1, both showing fast microtubule-independent turnover rates. Strikingly, primary fibroblasts from Clasp2 knockout mice show numerous spindle and chromosome segregation defects that can be partially rescued by ectopic expression of Clasp1 or Clasp2. Moreover, chromosome segregation rates during anaphase A and B are slower in Clasp2 knockout cells, which is consistent with a role of CLASP2 in the regulation of kinetochore and spindle function. Noteworthy, cell viability/proliferation and spindle checkpoint function were not impaired in Clasp2 knockout cells, but the fidelity of mitosis was strongly compromised, leading to severe chromosomal instability in adult cells.

abstract = {Accurate chromosome segregation requires timely bipolar spindle formation during mitosis. The transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC) family proteins and the ch-TOG family proteins are key players in bipolar spindle formation. They form a complex to stabilize spindle microtubules, mainly dependent on their localization to the centrosome (the spindle pole body [SPB] in yeast). The molecular mechanism underlying the targeting of the TACC-ch-TOG complex to the centrosome remains unclear. Here we show that the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe TACC orthologue alp7p is recruited to the SPB by csi1p. The csi1p-interacting region lies within the conserved TACC domain of alp7p, and the carboxyl-terminal domain of csi1p is responsible for interacting with alp7p. Compromised interaction between csi1p and alp7p impairs the localization of alp7p to the SPB during mitosis, thus delaying bipolar spindle formation and leading to anaphase B lagging chromosomes. Hence our study establishes that csi1p serves as a linking molecule tethering spindle-stabilizing factors to the SPB for promoting bipolar spindle assembly.},

In in vitro motility assays, full-length Cut7 moved toward minus-end of microtubules, but the N-terminal half of Cut7 moved toward the opposite direction. Furthermore, additional truncated constructs lacking the N-terminal or C-terminal regions, but still contained the motor domain, did not switch the motile direction.

abstract = {During development, the establishment of cell polarity is important for cells to undergo asymmetric cell divisions that give rise to diverse cell types. In C. elegans embryos, cues from the centrosome trigger the cortical flow of an actomyosin network, leading to the formation of anterior-posterior polarity. However, its precise mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that small GTPases have sequential and crucial functions in this process. ECT-2, a potential guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) for RHO-1, was uniformly distributed at the cortex before polarization, but was excluded from the posterior cortex by the polarity cue from the centrosomes. This local exclusion of ECT-2 led to an asymmetric RHO-1 distribution, which generated a cortical flow of the actomyosin that translocated PAR proteins and CDC-42 (Refs 4, 5) to the anterior cortex. Polarized CDC-42 was, in turn, involved in maintaining the established anterior-cortical domains. Our results suggest that a local change in the function of ECT-2 and RHO-1 links the centrosomal polarity cue with the polarization of the cell cortex.},

Wnt/Fz activation of Rho requires the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled (Dvl) and a novel Formin homology protein Daam1. Daam1 binds to both Dvl and Rho, and mediates Wnt-induced Dvl-Rho complex formation. Inhibition or depletion of Daam1 prevents Wnt/Fz activation of Rho and of Xenopus gastrulation, but not of $\beta$-catenin signaling.

This is possible because actin filaments are semi-flexible polymers that, in conjunction with the molecular motor myosin, can act as biological active springs or "dashpots" (in laymen's terms, shock absorbers or fluidizers) able to exert or resist against force in a cellular environment. To modulate their mechanical properties, actin filaments can organize into a variety of architectures generating a diversity of cellular organizations including branched or crosslinked networks in the lamellipodium, parallel bundles in filopodia, and antiparallel structures in contractile fibers. In this review we describe the feedback loop between biochemical and mechanical properties of actin organization at the molecular level in vitro, then we integrate this knowledge into our current understanding of cellular actin organization and its physiological roles.},

abstract = {Kinesin-5 is an essential mitotic motor. However, how its spatial-temporal distribution is regulated in mitosis remains poorly understood. We expressed localization and affinity purification-tagged Eg5 from a mouse bacterial artificial chromosome (this construct was called mEg5) and found its distribution to be tightly regulated throughout mitosis. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis showed rapid Eg5 turnover throughout mitosis, which cannot be accounted for by microtubule turnover. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and high-resolution, single-particle tracking revealed that mEg5 punctae on both astral and midzone microtubules rapidly bind and unbind. mEg5 punctae on midzone microtubules moved transiently both toward and away from spindle poles. In contrast, mEg5 punctae on astral microtubules moved transiently toward microtubule minus ends during early mitosis but switched to plus end-directed motion during anaphase. These observations explain the poleward accumulation of Eg5 in early mitosis and its redistribution in anaphase. Inhibition of dynein blocked mEg5 movement on astral microtubules, whereas depletion of the Eg5-binding protein TPX2 resulted in plus end-directed mEg5 movement. However, motion of Eg5 on midzone microtubules was not altered. Our results reveal differential and precise spatial and temporal regulation of Eg5 in the spindle mediated by dynein and TPX2. {\textcopyright} 2012 Gable et al.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}During metaphase, sister chromatids are connected to microtubules extending from the opposite spindle poles via kinetochores to protein complexes on the chromosome. Kinetochores congress to the equatorial plane of the spindle and oscillate around it, with kinesin-8 motors restricting these movements. Yet, the physical mechanism underlying kinetochore movements is unclear. We show that kinetochore movements in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe are regulated by kinesin-8-promoted microtubule catastrophe, force-induced rescue, and microtubule dynamic instability. A candidate screen showed that among the selected motors only kinesin-8 motors Klp5/Klp6 are required for kinetochore centering. Kinesin-8 accumulates at the end of microtubules, where it promotes catastrophe. Laser ablation of the spindle resulted in kinetochore movement toward the intact spindle pole in wild-type and klp5$\Delta$ cells, suggesting that kinetochore movement is driven by pulling forces. Our theoretical model with Langevin description of microtubule dynamic instability shows that kinesin-8 motors are required for kinetochore centering, whereas sensitivity of rescue to force is necessary for the generation of oscillations. We found that irregular kinetochore movements occur for a broader range of parameters than regular oscillations. Thus, our work provides an explanation for how regulation of microtubule dynamic instability contributes to kinetochore congression and the accompanying movements around the spindle center.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The motor domain of this protein is 61{\%} identical and 71{\%} similar to Pkl1p, another fission yeast KAR3 protein, yet the two enzymes are different in behavior and function. Pkl1p is nuclear throughout the cell cycle, whereas Klp2p is cytoplasmic during interphase. During mitosis Klp2p enters the nucleus where it forms about six chromatin-associated dots. In metaphase-arrested cells these migrate back and forth across the nucleus. During early anaphase they segregate with the chromosomes into two sets of about three, fade, and are replaced by other dots that form on the spindle interzone. Neither klp2(+) nor pkl1(+) is essential, and the double deletion is also wild type for both vegetative and sexual reproduction. Each deletion rescues different alleles of cut7(ts), a KLP that contributes to spindle formation and elongation. When either or both deletions are combined with a dynein deletion, vegetative growth is normal, but sexual reproduction fails: klp2 Delta,dhc1-d1 in karyogamy, pkl1 Delta,dhc1-d1 in multiple phases of meiosis, and the triple deletion in both. Deletion of Klp2p elongates a metaphase-arrested spindle, but pkl1 Delta shortens it. The anaphase spindle of klp2 Delta becomes longer than the cell, leading it to curl around the cell's ends. Apparently, Klp2p promotes spindle disassembly and contributes to the behavior of mitotic chromosomes.},

We find that PRC1's microtubule binding is mediated by a structured domain with a spectrin-fold and an unstructured Lys/Arg-rich domain. These two domains, at each end of a homodimer, are connected by a linkage that is flexible on single microtubules, but forms well-defined crossbridges between antiparallel filaments. Further, we show that PRC1 crosslinks are compliant and do not substantially resist filament sliding by motor proteins in vitro.

Fission yeast mutants defective in putative microtubule-site clamp Pcs1/Mde4 or Clr4/Swi6-dependent centromeric heterochromatin display high frequencies of lagging chromosomes during anaphase. Here, we developed an assay based on laser microsurgery to show that the stretched morphology of lagging kinetochores in pcs1$\Delta$ and clr4$\Delta$ mutant cells is due to merotelic attachment. We further show that Mde4 is regulated by Cdc2 and that Cdc2 activity prevents precocious localization of Mde4 to the metaphase spindle. Finally, we show that Pcs1/Mde4 complex shares similar features with the conserved kinetochore complex Spc24/Spc25 suggesting that these two complexes may occupy a similar functional niche. {\textcopyright} 2010 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {Members of the bimC family of kinesin related proteins (KRPs) play vital roles in the formation and function of the mitotic spindle. Although they share little amino acid homology outside the highly conserved microtubule motor domain, several family members do contain a 'bimC box', a sequence motif around a p34(cdc2) consensus phosphorylation site in their carboxy-terminal 'tail' region. One family member, Eg5, requires phosphorylation at this site for association with the mitotic spindle. We show that mutations in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cut7+ gene that change the bimC box p34(cdc2) consensus phosphorylation site at position 1011 and a neighbouring MAP kinase consensus phosphorylation site at position 1020 to non-phosphorylatable residues did not affect the ability of S. pombe cut7 genes to complement temperature sensitive cut7 mutants. Phosphorylation site mutants expressed as fusions to green fluorescent protein associated with the mitotic spindle with a localisation indistinguishable from similarly expressed wild-type Cut7. Cells in which cut7.T1011A replaced the genomic copy of cut7+ were viable and formed normal spindles. Deletion of the entire carboxy-terminal tail region did not affect the ability of Cut7 to associate with the mitotic spindle but did inhibit normal spindle formation. Thus, unlike Eg5, neither the p34(cdc2) consensus phosphorylation site in the bimC box nor the entire tail region of Cut7 are required for association with the mitotic spindle.},

abstract = {Spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is an evolutionarily conserved surveillance system for chromosome missegregation. We isolated fission yeast Hos2, a component of the Dam1/DASH complex, as a multicopy suppressor of temperature-sensitive (ts) growth of nnf1-495 mutant that exhibits the minichromosome in stability (mis) phenotype, producing lethal aneuploids without prominent mitotic delay. It remains elusive why SAC is satisfied in mis mutants despite the occurrence of missegregation. We found that Hos2 binds to the inner-kinetochore regions in both prometaphase and metaphase. Hos2 is essential for kinetochore localization of Dis1, a microtubule (MT) associated Dis1/XMAP215/TOG family protein that is required for proper MT dynamics. Cells lacking DASH exhibit cold-sensitive (cs) growth with the defective in sister-chromatid disjoining (dis) phenotype, which is characterized by hyper-condensed sister-chromatid pairs and elongated spindle MTs. Although DASH-deficient cells are viable at high temperatures, DASH-deletion transforms all the inner-kinetochore mis mutants so far tested into a constitutively active state of SAC, leading to the dis phenotype. We also discovered that Hos2 over-expression commonly suppresses growth retardation in a variety of inner-kinetochore mutants. These genetic interactions highlight the DASH-action(s) in satisfying SAC when aneuploids are formed during mitosis in the inner-kinetochore-defective mis mutants. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Molecular Biology Society of Japan/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Ubiquitous to the mechanism of spindle assembly and stability are balanced Kinesin-5 promoting and Kinesin-14 opposing forces. Distinct Kinesin-14 roles in bipolarity in eukaryotes have not been shown, but are suggested by $\gamma$-tubulin-based pole interactions that affect establishment and by microtubule cross-linking and sliding that maintain bipolarity and spindle length. Distinct roles also imply specialized functional domains. By cross-species analysis of compatible mechanisms in establishing mitotic bipolarity we demonstrate that Kinesin-14 human HSET (HsHSET) functionally replaces Schizosaccharomyces pombe Pkl1 and its action is similarly blocked by mutation in a Kinesin-14 binding site on $\gamma$-tubulin.

abstract = {Midzone microtubules of mammalian cells play an essential role in the induction of cell cleavage, serving as a platform for a number of proteins that play a part in cytokinesis. We demonstrate that PRC1, a mitotic spindle-associated Cdk substrate that is essential to cell cleavage, is a microtubule binding and bundling protein both in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of PRC1 extensively bundles interphase microtubules, but does not affect early mitotic spindle organization. PRC1 contains two Cdk phosphorylation motifs, and phosphorylation is possibly important to mitotic suppression of bundling, as a Cdk phosphorylation-null mutant causes extensive bundling of the prometaphase spindle. Complete suppression of PRC1 by siRNA causes failure of microtubule interdigitation between half spindles and the absence of a spindle midzone. Truncation mutants demonstrate that the NH2-terminal region of PRC1, rich in alpha-helical sequence, is important for localization to the cleavage furrow and to the center of the midbody, whereas the central region, with the highest sequence homology between species, is required for microtubule binding and bundling activity. We conclude that PRC1 is a microtubule-associated protein required to maintain the spindle midzone, and that distinct functions are associated with modular elements of the primary sequence.},

abstract = {The totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) is a paradigmatic stochastic model for non-equilibrium physics, and has been successfully applied to describe active transport of molecular motors along cytoskeletal filaments. Building on this simple model, we consider a two-lane lattice-gas model that couples directed transport (TASEP) to diffusive motion in a semi-closed geometry, and simultaneously accounts for spontaneous growth and particle-induced shrinkage of the system's size. This particular extension of the TASEP is motivated by the question of how active transport and diffusion might influence length regulation in confined systems. Surprisingly, we find that the size of our intrinsically stochastic system exhibits robust temporal patterns over a broad range of growth rates. More specifically, when particle diffusion is slow relative to the shrinkage dynamics, we observe quasi-periodic changes in length. We provide an intuitive explanation for the occurrence of these self-organized temporal patterns, which is based on the imbalance between the diffusion and shrinkage speed in the confined geometry. Finally, we formulate an effective theory for the oscillatory regime, which explains the origin of the oscillations and correctly predicts the dependence of key quantities, as for instance the oscillation frequency, on the growth rate.},

abstract = {Proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is one intrinsic property of metastatic tumor cells to breach tissue barriers and to disseminate into different tissues. This process is initiated by the formation of invadopodia, which are actin-driven, finger-like membrane protrusions. Yet, little is known on how invadopodia are endowed with the functional machinery of proteolytic enzymes [1, 2]. The key protease MT1-MMP (membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase) confers proteolytic activity to invadopodia and thus invasion capacity of cancer cells [3-6]. Here, we report that MT1-MMP-dependent matrix degradation at invadopodia is regulated by the v-SNARE TI-VAMP/VAMP7, hence providing the molecular inventory mediating focal degradative activity of cancer cells. As observed by TIRF microscopy, MT1-MMP-mCherry and GFP-VAMP7 were simultaneously detected at proteolytic sites. Functional ablation of VAMP7 decreased the ability of breast cancer cells to degrade and invade in a MT1-MMP-dependent fashion. Moreover, the number of invadopodia was dramatically decreased in VAMP7- and MT1-MMP-depleted cells, indicative of a positive-feedback loop in which the protease as a cargo of VAMP7-targeted transport vesicles regulates maturation of invadopodia. Collectively, these data point to a specific role of VAMP7 in delivering MT1-MMP to sites of degradation, maintaining the functional machinery required for invasion.},

Upon mitotic commitment, the nuclear envelope separating these domains disperses as the two SPBs integrate into a hole that forms in the nuclear envelope. The SPB component Cut12 is linked to cell cycle control, as dominant cut12.s11 mutations suppress the mitotic commitment defect of cdc25.22 cells and elevated Cdc25 levels suppress the monopolar spindle phenotype of cut12.1 loss of function mutations. We show that the cut12.1 monopolar phenotype arises from a failure to activate and integrate the new SPB into the nuclear envelope. The activation of the old SPB was frequently delayed, and its integration into the nuclear envelope was defective, resulting in leakage of the nucleoplasm into the cytoplasm through large gaps in the nuclear envelope. We propose that these activation/integration defects arise from a local deficiency in mitosis-promoting factor activation at the new SPB. {\textcopyright} 2009 Tallada et al.},

In human female meiosis, however, spindle assembly occurs in the absence of centrosomes or other MTOCs and microtubules are nucleated around chromosomes. In yeast, spindle formation in mitosis and meiosis depends on the activity of spindle pole bodies (SPBs), the functional equivalents of centrosomes; thus, SPBs and centrosomes use similar machineries to assemble spindles. Here, we develop a system to explore the molecular mechanisms supporting acentrosomal spindle formation using fission yeast meiosis as a model scenario. We achieve this situation by removing access of the SPBs to the nucleus after their duplication. Under these conditions, we observe self-assembly-based spindle formation in the nuclear environment, conferring an ability to segregate chromosomes independently of the SPBs. Our results open the possibility to utilize the experimental advantages of fission yeast for insights into the molecular basis of acentrosomal spindle formation in meiosis.},

Ultimately, the challenge remains to understand how the collective behaviour of these nanometre-scale processes gives rise to a properly sized spindle on the micrometre scale. By systematically engineering the enzymatic activity of XMAP215, a processive microtubule polymerase3,4, we show that Xenopus laevis spindle length increases linearly with microtubule growth velocity, whereas other parameters of spindle organization, such as microtubule density, lifetime and spindle shape, remain constant. We further show that mass balance can be used to link the global property of spindle size to individual microtubule dynamic parameters.

abstract = {The survival of eukaryotes depends on the accurate coordination of mitosis with cytokinesis. Key for the coordination of both processes is the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) comprising Aurora-B, INCENP, survivin, and borealin [1-5]. The translocation of the CPC from centromeres to the spindle midzone, a structure composed of antiparallel microtubules, at anaphase onset is critical for the completion of cytokinesis [6-12]. In mammalian cells, the mitotic kinesin Mklp2 is essential for recruitment of the CPC to the spindle midzone [13]. However, the mechanism regulating the binding of Mklp2 to microtubules has remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Mklp2 and the CPC mutually depend on each other for midzone localization; i.e., Mklp2 is mislocalized in INCENP-RNAi cells and vice versa. Remarkably, INCENP is required for localization of Mklp2 to the ends of stable microtubules in cells with low Cdk1 activity. In vitro assays revealed that the association between the CPC and Mklp2 is negatively regulated by Cdk1. Collectively, our data suggest that anaphase onset triggers the association between the CPC and Mklp2 and that this association targets the CPC-Mklp2 complex to the ends of stable microtubules in the spindle midzone. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To better determine how RNA substrates are targeted, we analyzed protein and RNA interactions for TRAMP components. Mass spectrometry identified three distinct TRAMP complexes formed in vivo. These complexes preferentially assemble on different classes of transcripts. Unexpectedly, on many substrates, including pre-rRNAs and pre-mRNAs, binding specificity is apparently conferred by Trf4 and Trf5. Clustering of mRNAs by TRAMP association shows co-enrichment for mRNAs with functionally related products, supporting the significance of surveillance in regulating gene expression. We compared binding sites of TRAMP components with multiple nuclear RNA binding proteins, revealing preferential colocalization of subsets of factors.

We used single-molecule microscopy to understand the mechanism of length-dependent depolymerization by the budding yeast kinesin-8, Kip3p. We found that after binding at a random position on a microtubule and walking to the plus end, an individual Kip3p molecule pauses there until an incoming Kip3p molecule bumps it off. Kip3p dissociation is accompanied by removal of just one or two tubulin dimers (on average). Such a cooperative mechanism leads to a depolymerization rate that is proportional to the flux of motors to the microtubule end and accounts for the length dependence of depolymerization. This type of feedback between length and disassembly may serve as a model for understanding how an ensemble of molecules can measure and control polymer length. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report the first in vivo analysis of microtubule dynamics in cells lacking a member of this protein family. For these studies, we have used a conditional Stu2p depletion strain expressing $\alpha$-tubulin fused to green fluorescent protein. Depletion of Stu2p leads to fewer and less dynamic cytoplasmic microtubules in both G1 and preanaphase cells. The reduction in cytoplasmic microtubule dynamics is due primarily to decreases in both the catastrophe and rescue frequencies and an increase in the fraction of time microtubules spend pausing. These changes have significant consequences for the cell because they impede the ability of cytoplasmic microtubules to orient the spindle. In addition, recovery of fluorescence after photobleaching indicates that kinetochore microtubules are no longer dynamic in the absence of Stu2p. This deficiency is correlated with a failure to properly align chromosomes at metaphase. Overall, we provide evidence that Stu2p promotes the dynamics of microtubule plus-ends in vivo and that these dynamics are critical for microtubule interactions with kinetochores and cortical sites in the cytoplasm.},

In cells with turgor, pressure opposes membrane deformations, and increases the amount of force that has to be generated by the endocytic machinery. To determine this force, and calculate the shape of the membrane, we used physical theory to model an elastic surface under pressure. Accurate fits of experimental profiles are obtained assuming that the coated membrane is highly rigid and preferentially curved at the endocytic site. The forces required from the actin machinery peaks at the onset of deformation, indicating that once invagination has been initiated, endocytosis is unlikely to stall before completion. Coat proteins do not lower the initiation force but may affect the process by the curvature they induce. In the presence of isotropic curvature inducers, pulling the tip of the invagination can trigger the formation of a neck at the base of the invagination. Hence direct neck constriction by actin may not be required, while its pulling role is essential. Finally, the theory shows that anisotropic curvature effectors stabilize membrane invaginations, and the loss of crescent-shaped BAR domain proteins such as Rvs167 could therefore trigger membrane scission.},

As healthcare has been improved worldwide, the number of immunocompromised patients has been increased to a greater extent and they are highly susceptible to various pathogenic microbes and C. albicans has been prominent among the fungal pathogens. The complete genome sequence of this pathogen is now available and has been extremely useful for the identification of repertoire of genes present in this pathogen. The major challenge is now to assign the functions to these genes of which 13{\%} are specific to C. albicans . Due to its close relationship with yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , an edge over other fungal pathogens because most of the technologies can be directly transferred to C. albicans from S. cerevisiae and it is amenable to mutation, gene disruption, and transformation. The last two decades have witnessed enormous amount of research activities on this pathogen that leads to the understanding of host-parasite interaction, infections, and disease propagation. Clearly, C. albicans has emerged as a model organism for studying fungal pathogens along with other two fungi Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans . Understanding its complete life style of C. albicans will undoubtedly be useful for developing potential antifungal drugs and tackling Candida infections. This will also shed light on the functioning of other fungal pathogens. },

abstract = {Although animals switch to backward walking upon sensing an obstacle or danger in their path, the initiation and execution of backward locomotion is poorly understood. The discovery of Moonwalker Descending Neurons (MDNs), made Drosophila useful to study neural circuits underlying backward locomotion. MDNs were demonstrated to receive visual and mechanosensory inputs. However, whether other modalities converge onto MDNs and what are the neural circuits activating MDNs are unknown. We show that aversive but not appetitive olfactory input triggers MDN mediated backward locomotion. We identify in each hemisphere, a single Moonwalker Subesophageal Zone neuron (MooSEZ), which triggers backward locomotion. MooSEZs act both upstream and in parallel to MDNs. Surprisingly, MooSEZs also respond mostly to aversive odors. Contrary to MDNs, blocking MooSEZs activity has little effect on odor-evoked backward locomotion. Thus, this work reveals another important modality input to MDNs in addition to a novel olfactory pathway and MDN-independent backward locomotion pathway.},

The physical origin of this concentration-dependence is unexplained.

Concentration-dependent unbinding is generated by this simple model, quantitatively explaining experimental data. This effect is likely to play a major role in determining binding lifetimes of proteins in vivo where there are very high concentrations of solvated molecules.},

abstract = {Cellular organelles such as the mitotic spindle adjust their size to the dimensions of the cell. It is widely understood that spindle scaling is governed by regulation of microtubule polymerization. Here we use quantitative microscopy in living zebrafish embryos and Xenopus egg extracts in combination with theory to show that microtubule polymerization dynamics are insufficient to scale spindles and only contribute below a critical cell size. In contrast, microtubule nucleation governs spindle scaling for all cell sizes. We show that this hierarchical regulation arises from the partitioning of a nucleation inhibitor to the cell membrane. Our results reveal that cells differentially regulate microtubule number and length using distinct geometric cues to maintain a functional spindle architecture over a large range of cell sizes.

abstract = {The mechanism for forming linear microtubule (MT) arrays in cells such as neurons, polarized epithelial cells, and myotubes is not well understood. A simpler bipolar linear array is the fission yeast interphase MT bundle, which in its basic form contains two MTs that are bundled at their minus ends. Here, we characterize mto2p as a novel fission yeast protein required for MT nucleation from noncentrosomal $\gamma$-tubulin complexes ($\gamma$-TuCs). In interphase mto2$\Delta$ cells, MT nucleation was strongly inhibited, and MT bundling occurred infrequently and only when two MTs met by chance in the cytoplasm. In wild-type 2, we observed MT nucleation from $\gamma$-TuCs bound along the length of existing MTs. We propose a model on how these nucleation events can more efficiently drive the formation of bipolar MT bundles in interphase. Key to the model is our observation of selective antiparallel binding of MTs, which can both explain the generation and spatial separation of multiple bipolar bundles.},

@article{Concha1998,
abstract = {We have taken advantage of the optical transparency of zebrafish embryos to investigate the patterns of cell division, movement and shape during early stages of development of the central nervous system. The surface- most epiblast cells of gastrula and neurula stage embryos were imaged and analysed using a computer-based, time- lapse acquisition system attached to a differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope. We find that the onset of gastrulation is accompanied by major changes in cell behaviour. Cells collect into a cohesive sheet, apparently losing independent motility and integrating their behaviour to move coherently over the yolk in a direction that is the result of two influences: towards the vegetal pole in the movements of epiboly and towards the dorsal midline in convergent movements that strengthen throughout gastrulation. Coincidentally, the plane of cell division becomes aligned to the surface plane of the embryo and oriented in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction. These behaviours begin at the blastoderm margin and propagate in a gradient towards the animal pole. Later in gastrulation, cells undergo increasingly mediolateral- directed elongation and autonomous convergence movements towards the dorsal midline leading to an enormous extension of the neural axis. Around the equator and along the dorsal midline of the gastrula, persistent AP orientation of divisions suggests that a common mechanism may be involved but that neither oriented cell movements nor shape can account for this alignment. When the neural plate begins to differentiate, there is a gradual transition in the direction of cell division from AP to the mediolateral circumference (ML). ML divisions occur in both the ventral epidermis and dorsal neural plate. In the neural plate, ML becomes the predominant orientation of division during neural keel and nerve rod stages and, from late neural keel stage, divisions are concentrated at the dorsal midline and generate bilateral progeny (C. Papan and J. A. Campos-Ortega (1994) Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 203, 178-186). Coincidentally, cells on the ventral surface also orient their divisions in the ML direction, cleaving perpendicular to the direction in which they are elongated. The ML alignment of epidermal divisions is well correlated with cell shape but ML divisions within the neuroepithelium appear to be better correlated with changes in tissue morphology associated with neurulation.},

Although the network components and their properties are known, and networks can be reconstituted in vitro, the requirements for contractility are still poorly understood. Here, we describe a theory that predicts whether an isotropic network will contract, expand, or conserve its dimensions. This analytical theory correctly predicts the behavior of simulated networks, consisting of filaments with varying combinations of connectors, and reveals conditions under which networks of rigid filaments are either contractile or expansile. Our results suggest that pulsatility is an intrinsic behavior of contractile networks if the filaments are not stable but turn over. The theory offers a unifying framework to think about mechanisms of contractions or expansion. It provides the foundation for studying a broad range of processes involving cytoskeletal networks and a basis for designing synthetic networks.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The septation initiation network (SIN) and mitotic exit network (MEN) signaling pathways regulate cytokinesis and mitotic exit in the yeasts Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. One function of these pathways is to keep the Cdc14-family phosphatase, called Clp1 in S. pombe, from being sequestered and inhibited in the nucleolus. In S. pombe, the SIN and Clp1 act as part of a cytokinesis checkpoint that allows cells to cope with cytokinesis defects. The SIN promotes checkpoint function by 1) keeping Clp1 out of the nucleolus, 2) maintaining the cytokinetic apparatus, and 3) halting the cell cycle until cytokinesis is completed. In a screen for suppressors of the SIN mutant cytokinesis checkpoint defect, we identified a novel nucleolar protein called Dnt1 and other nucleolar proteins, including Rrn5 and Nuc1, which are known to be required for rDNA transcription. Dnt1 shows sequence homology to Net1/Cfi1, which encodes the nucleolar inhibitor of Cdc14 in budding yeast. Like Net1/Cfi1, Dnt1 is required for rDNA silencing and minichromosome maintenance, and both Dnt1 and Net1/Cfi1 negatively regulate the homologous SIN and MEN pathways. Unlike Net1/Cfi1, which regulates the MEN through the Cdc14 phosphatase, Dnt1 can inhibit SIN signaling independently of Clp1, suggesting a novel connection between the nucleolus and the SIN pathway.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
annote = {Cdc14/Clp1 phosphatase activity is regulated by at least release from the nucleolus

Mutants in the SIN or in Clp1 are sensitive to perturbations delaying cytokinesis, since they will resume the cell cycle even if cytokinesis didnt finish, and form multi-nucleated cells.

They find multiple supressors. Some of them known rRNA transcription proteins that also caused growth problems. However, they also find Dnt1, which is deleterious when combined with other rRNA nucleolar proteins, but not on its own.

Dnt1D cells therefore have a more active SIN, suggeting that Dnt1 is a SIN repressor.

This is independent of clp1D, because SINts clp1D cells (which normally die) are rescued by Dnt1D, meaning that Dnt1D is not simply releasing clp1 from the nucleolus (they actually see that clp1 comes back to the nucleolus when SIN is active in Dnt1D!)},

abstract = {Genomic instability (GIN) is a hallmark of cancer cells that facilitates the acquisition of mutations conferring aggressive or drug-resistant phenotypes during cancer evolution. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a form of GIN that involves frequent cytogenetic changes leading to changes in chromosome copy number (aneuploidy). While both CIN and aneuploidy are common characteristics of cancer cells, their roles in tumor initiation and progression are unclear. On the one hand, CIN and aneuploidy are known to provide genetic variation to allow cells to adapt in changing environments such as nutrient fluctuations and hypoxia. Patients with constitutive aneuploidies are more susceptible to certain types of cancers, suggesting that changes in chromosome copy number could positively contribute to cancer evolution. On the other hand, chromosomal imbalances have been observed to have detrimental effects on cellular fitness and might trigger cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Furthermore, mouse models for CIN have led to conflicting results. Taken together these findings suggest that the relationship between CIN, aneuploidy and cancer is more complex than what was previously anticipated. Here we review what is known about this complex m{\'{e}}nage {\`{a}} trois, discuss recent evidence suggesting that aneuploidy, CIN and GIN together promote a vicious cycle of genome chaos. Lastly, we propose a working hypothesis to reconcile the conflicting observations regarding the role of aneuploidy and CIN in tumorigenesis.},

In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, an equatorial MTOC (eMTOC) at the cell division site disassembles after cytokinesis, and multiple interphase MTOCs (iMTOCs) appear on the nucleus. Here, we show that, upon eMTOC disassembly, small satellites carrying MTOC components such as the gamma-tubulin complex travel in both directions along interphase MTs. We identify rsp1p, an MTOC protein required for eMTOC disassembly. In rsp1 loss-of-function mutants, the eMTOC persists and organizes an abnormal microtubule aster, while iMTOCs and satellites are greatly reduced. Conversely, rsp1p overexpression inhibits eMTOC formation. Rsp1p is a J domain protein that interacts with an hsp70. Thus, our findings suggest a model in which rsp1p is part of a chaperone-based mechanism that disassembles the eMTOC into satellites, contributing to the dynamic redistribution of MTOC components for organization of interphase microtubules.},

abstract = {Our previous studies conducted in MCF7-ptsp53 cells have demonstrated that overexpression of the wild-type (wt) p53 at permissive temperature 32 degrees C leads to growth arrest at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. To identify novel p53-regulated genes that are responsible for the p53-induced G2/M arrest, we conducted cDNA microarray analyses. The array results indicated that the mRNA level of protein regulator of cytokinesis (PRC1) was significantly decreased when the p53 transactivation activity was turned on, suggesting that PRC1 transcription could be downregulated by p53. In this study, we have extensively examined the functional role of p53 in the regulation of PRC1, a cell cycle protein that plays important roles during cytokinesis. We demonstrate that increased expression of the wt p53 either by exogenous transfection or chemical induction results in reduced mRNA and protein expression of PRC1 in HCT116 p53(+/+), HCT116 p53(-/-), MCF-7, T47D, and HeLa cells. Importantly, we show that the decreased PRC1 expression is accompanied by the appearance of binucleated cells, indicating the process of cell division after mitosis being inhibited. By isolation and characterization of a 3 kb genomic fragment containing the 5'-flanking region and part of exon 1 of PRC1 gene, we demonstrate that p53 directly suppresses PRC1 gene transcription. We further locate the p53-responsive sequence to the proximal promoter region -214 to -163, relative to the transcriptional start site. The in vivo interaction of p53 with PRC1 gene promoter is further demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Taken together, these new findings suggest that p53 may have important roles in the regulation of cytokinesis through controlling the transcription of PRC1.},

The tagged p93dis1 in living cells localizes along cytoplasmic microtubule arrays in interphase and the elongating anaphase spindle in mitosis, but association with the short metaphase spindle microtubules is strikingly reduced. In the spindle, the tagged p93dis1 is enriched at the spindle pole bodies (SPBs). Time-lapse video images of single cells support the localization shift of p93dis1 to the SPBs in metaphase and spindle microtubules in anaphase. The carboxy-terminal fragment, which is essential for Dis1 function, accumulates around the mitotic SPB. We propose that these localization shifts of p93dis1 in mitosis facilitates sister chromatid separation by affecting SPB and anaphase spindle function.},

abstract = {Bipolar spindle assembly requires force to organize the microtubule network. Here, we show that three motor proteins, namely Eg5, Kif15, and dynein, act together to produce the right force balance in the spindle. Excessive inward force results in monopolar spindle formation, while excessive outward force generation results in unstable spindles with splayed spindle poles. Blocking activity of all three motors prevents bipolar spindle formation, but established bipolar spindles are refractory to loss of all motor activity. Further analysis shows that although these preformed spindles remain bipolar, outward force generation is required to establish sufficient tension on kinetochores and to accomplish successful chromosome segregation. Together, these results show how Eg5, Kif15, and dynein work together to build abipolar spindle and reveal an important role for antagonistic motors in chromosome segregation. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

Certain features, such as the occurrence of DNA breaks associated with recombination, appear similar, suggesting that these features may be common in eukaryotes.

abstract = {During mitosis, chromosomes become attached to microtubules that emanate from the two spindle poles. Thereafter, a chromosome moves along these microtubule "tracks" as it executes a series of movements that bring it to the spindle equator. After the onset of anaphase, the sister chromatids separate and move to opposite spindle poles. These movements are often characterized by "directional instability" (a series of runs with approximately constant speed, punctuated by sudden reversals in the direction of movement). To understand mitosis, it is critical to describe the physical mechanisms that underlie the coordination of the forces that drive directional instability. We propose a simple mechanistic model that describes the origin of the forces that move chromosomes and the coordination of these forces to produce directional instability. The model demonstrates that forces, speeds, and direction of motion associated with prometaphase through anaphase chromosome movements can be predicted from the molecular kinetics of interactions between dynamic microtubules and arrays of microtubule binding sites that are linked to the chromosome by compliant elements.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Cell division is critical for development, organ growth, and tissue repair. The later stages of cell division include the formation of the microtubule (MT)-rich central spindle in anaphase, which is required to properly define the cell equator, guide the assembly of the acto-myosin contractile ring and ultimately ensure complete separation and isolation of the two daughter cells via abscission. Much is known about the molecular machinery that forms the central spindle, including proteins needed to generate the antiparallel overlapping interzonal MTs. One critical protein that has garnered great attention is the protein regulator of cytokinesis 1, or Fascetto (Feo) in Drosophila, which forms a homodimer to cross-link interzonal MTs, ensuring proper central spindle formation and cytokinesis. Here, we report on a new direct protein interactor and regulator of Feo we named Feo interacting protein (FIP). Loss of FIP results in a reduction in Feo localization, rapid disassembly of interzonal MTs, and several defects related to cytokinesis failure, including polyploidization of neural stem cells. Simultaneous reduction in Feo and FIP results in very large, tumorlike DNA-filled masses in the brain that contain hundreds of centrosomes. In aggregate, our data show that FIP acts directly on Feo to ensure fully accurate cell division.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The mitotic spindle consists of two types of microtubules. Dynamic kinetochore microtubules capture kinetochores, whereas stable interpolar microtubules serve as the structural backbone that connects the two spindle poles. Both have been believed to be indispensable for cell division in eukaryotes. Here we demonstrate that interpolar microtubules are dispensable for the second division of meiosis in fission yeast. Even when interpolar microtubules are disrupted by a microtubule-depolymerizing drug, spindle poles separate and chromosomes segregate poleward in second division of meiosis in most zygotes, producing viable spores. The forespore membrane, which encapsulates the nucleus in second division of meiosis and is guided by septins and the leading-edge proteins, is responsible for carrying out meiotic events in the absence of interpolar microtubules. Furthermore, during physiological second division of meiosis without microtubule perturbation, the forespore membrane assembly contributes structurally to spindle pole separation and nuclear division, generating sufficient force for spindle pole separation and subsequent events independently of interpolar microtubules.},

abstract = {During mitosis, sister chromatids congress to the spindle equator and are subsequently segregated via attachment to dynamic kinetochore microtubule (kMT) plus ends. A major question is how kMT plus-end assembly is spatially regulated to achieve chromosome congression. Here we find in budding yeast that the widely conserved kinesin-5 sliding motor proteins, Cin8p and Kip1p, mediate chromosome congression by suppressing kMT plus-end assembly of longer kMTs. Of the two, Cin8p is the major effector and its activity requires a functional motor domain. In contrast, the depolymerizing kinesin-8 motor Kip3p plays a minor role in spatial regulation of yeast kMT assembly. Our analysis identified a model where kinesin-5 motors bind to kMTs, move to kMT plus ends, and upon arrival at a growing plus end promote net kMT plus-end disassembly. In conclusion, we find that length-dependent control of net kMT assembly by kinesin-5 motors yields a simple and stable self-organizing mechanism for chromosome congression.},
annote = {From the intro it seems that kinesin-8 has no effect of kt microtubules, and kinesin-5 does. They say that the fact that kinesin-5 can crosslink targets it to the kt-microtubules, and because kinesin-8 cant, its targeted to ip-microtubules.

They start from a simulation in which they simulate how would kinetochores localise in a spindle (pressumably of constant length), if there was a length dependent promoter of depolymerisation of microtubules.

Cin8 (one kinesin-5) deletion causes the loss of clustering of kinetochores at the sides of half spindles, and brings them to the center.

Kip1 (other kin-5) has a similar but milder effect.

They use another mechanism to make spindles longer with more compliant centromeres, and they still see the defect in kt-microtubule positionin for kin-5D.

Overexpression of kinesin-5 makes the spindle longer, but also makes the kt microtubules shorter.

They see the same thing in EM. More microtubules wihich are longer.

Here deletion of kin-8 does not change this organistation, slightly longer spindle but they say its because of ip mts.

Even astral microtubules are longer in the absence of cin8, and shorter in OE of cin8

They frap part of the spindle and they can see the movement of kin-5 dots towards the plus end

They also see that the density of kin-5 peaks at the kinetochore, consistent with length dependent accumulation.

Kinesiin-8 signal is kind of diffuse, while kiensin-5 signal is very distintcly localised to kt

All the initial simulations are done with spatially gradient of catastrophe, only at the end in the self-organised they use kin-5 mediated catastrophe.

Although there is a clear role for microtubule (MT) motor proteins at the spindle midzone, less is known about how microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) contribute to midzone organization and function. Here, we report that budding yeast Ase1p is a member of a conserved family of midzone-specific MAPs. By size exclusion chromatography and velocity sedimentation, both Ase1p in extracts and purified Ase1p behaved as a homodimer. Ase1p bound and bundled MTs in vitro. By live cell microscopy, loss of Ase1p resulted in a specific defect: premature spindle disassembly in mid-anaphase. Furthermore, when overexpressed, Ase1p was sufficient to trigger spindle elongation in S phase-arrested cells. FRAP revealed that Ase1p has both a very slow rate of turnover within the midzone and limited lateral diffusion along spindle MTs. We propose that Ase1p functions as an MT cross-bridge that imparts matrix-like characteristics to the midzone. MT-dependent networks of spindle midzone MAPs may be one molecular basis for the postulated spindle matrix.},

Lem2 deletion increases membrane flow into and out of the nuclear envelope in response to changes in membrane synthesis and nucleocytoplasmic transport, altering nuclear size. The endoplasmic reticulum protein Lnp1 acts as a secondary barrier to membrane flow, functionally compensating for lack of Lem2. We propose that this is part of the mechanism that maintains nuclear size proportional to cellular membrane content and thus to cell size. Similar regulatory principles may apply to other organelles in the eukaryotic subcellular membrane network.},

abstract = {In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, before the onset of anaphase, the spindle apparatus is always positioned with one spindle pole at, or through, the neck between the mother cell and the growing bud. This spindle orientation enables proper chromosome segregation to occur during anaphase, allowing one replicated genome to be segregated into the bud and the other to remain in the mother cell. In this study, we synchronized a population of cells before the onset of anaphase such that {\textgreater} 90{\%} of the cells in the population had spindles with the correct orientation, and then disrupted specific cytoskeletal elements using temperature-sensitive mutations. Disruption of either the astral microtubules or actin function resulted in improper spindle orientation in approximately 40-50{\%} of the cells. When cells with disrupted astral microtubules or actin function entered into anaphase, there was a 100-200-fold increase in the frequency of binucleated cell bodies. Thus, the maintenance of proper spindle orientation by these cytoskeletal elements was essential for proper chromosome segregation. These data are consistent with the model that proper spindle orientation is maintained by directly or indirectly tethering the astral microtubules to the actin cytoskeleton. After nuclear migration, but before anaphase, bulk chromosome movement occurs within the nucleus apparently because the chromosomes are attached to a mobile spindle. The frequency and magnitude of bulk chromosome movement is greatly diminished by disruption of the astral microtubules but not by disruption of the nonkinetochore spindle microtubules. These results suggest that astral microtubules are not only important for spindle orientation before anaphase, but they also mediate force on the spindle, generating spindle displacement and in turn chromosome movement. Potential roles for this force in spindle assembly and orientation are discussed.},

abstract = {Gastrulation in the amniote begins with the formation of a primitive streak through which precursors of definitive mesoderm and endoderm ingress and migrate to their embryonic destinations. This organizing center for amniote gastrulation is induced by signal(s) from the posterior margin of the blastodisc. The mode of action of these inductive signal(s) remains unresolved, since various origins and developmental pathways of the primitive streak have been proposed. In the present study, the fate of chicken blastodermal cells was traced for the first time in ovo from prestreak stages XI-XII through HH stage 3, when the primitive streak is initially established and prior to the migration of mesoderm. Using replication-defective retrovirus-mediated gene transfer and vital dye labeling, precursor cells of the stage 3 primitive streak were mapped predominantly to a specific region where the embryonic midline crosses the posterior margin of the epiblast. No significant contribution to the early primitive streak was seen from the anterolateral epiblast. Instead, the precursor cells generated daughter cells that underwent a polarized cell division oriented perpendicular to the anteroposterior embryonic axis. The resulting daughter cell population was arranged in a longitudinal array extending the complete length of the primitive streak. Furthermore, expression of cVg1, a posterior margin-derived signal, at the anterior marginal zone induced adjacent epiblast cells, but not those lateral to or distant from the signal, to form an ectopic primitive streak. The cVg1-induced epiblast cells also exhibited polarized cell divisions during ectopic primitive streak formation. These results suggest that blastoderm cells located immediately anterior to the posterior marginal zone, which secretes an inductive signal, undergo spatially directed cytokineses during early primitive streak formation.},

We explored the nature of forces governing the positioning and elongation of the mitotic spindle in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We hypothesized that astral microtubules exert mechanical force on the S. pombe spindle and thus help align the spindle with the major axis of the cell [1, 2]. Microtubules were tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) [3] and visualized by two-photon microscopy. Forces were inferred both from time-lapse imaging of mitotic cells and, more directly, from mechanical perturbations induced by laser dissection [4, 5] of the spindle and astral microtubules. We found that astral microtubules push on the spindle poles in S. pombe, in contrast to the pulling forces observed in a number of other cell types [4, 6–9]. Further, laser dissection of the spindle midzone induced spindle collapse inward. This offers direct evidence in support of the hypothesis that spindle elongation is driven by the sliding apart of antiparallel microtubules in the spindle midzone [10, 11]. Broken spindles recovered and mitosis completed as usual. We propose a model of spindle centering and elongation by microtubule-based pushing forces.},

However, in contrast to other members of the kinesin-14 family, H. sapiens kinesin-14 HSET has so far never been observed to be prominently located at microtubule plus ends. Here, using an in vitro microtubule dynamics reconstitution assay we observe tip-tracking of GFP-HSET in the presence of H. sapiens EB1 (hsEB1). Tip-tracking depended on the SxIP-like motif in HSET as well as on the EB homology domain in hsEB1. D. melanogaster Ncd and S. pombe Klp2 tip-tracking reconstitution assays accompanied by kinesin-14 amino acid sequence comparisons suggest that SxIP-like motif mediated tip-tracking dependent on EB family proteins is conserved in the kinesin-14 family of molecular motors.},

abstract = {Female meiosis in higher organisms consists of highly asymmetric divisions, which retain most maternal stores in the oocyte for embryo development. Asymmetric partitioning of the cytoplasm results from the spindle's "off-center" positioning, which, in mouse oocytes, depends mainly on actin filaments [1, 2]. This is a unique situation compared to most systems, in which spindle positioning requires interactions between astral microtubules and cortical actin filaments [3]. Formin 2, a straight-actin-filament nucleator, is required for the first meiotic spindle migration to the cortex and cytokinesis in mouse oocytes [4, 5]. Although the requirement for actin filaments in the control of spindle positioning is well established in this model, no one has been able to detect them in the cytoplasm [6]. Through the expression of an F-actin-specific probe and live confocal microscopy, we show the presence of a cytoplasmic actin meshwork, organized by Formin 2, that controls spindle migration. In late meiosis I, these filaments organize into a spindle-like F-actin structure, which is connected to the cortex. At anaphase, global reorganization of this meshwork allows polar-body extrusion. In addition, using actin-YFP, our FRAP analysis confirms the presence of a highly dynamic cytoplasmic actin meshwork that is tightly regulated in time and space. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Zebrafish gastrulation entails morphogenetic cell movements that shape the body plan and give rise to an embryo with defined anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes. Regulating these cell movements are diverse signaling pathways and proteins including Wnts, Src-family tyrosine kinases, cadherins, and matrix metalloproteinases. While our knowledge of how these proteins impact cell polarity and migration has advanced considerably in the last decade, almost no data exist regarding the organization of extracellular matrix (ECM) during zebrafish gastrulation. Here, we describe for the first time the assembly of a fibronectin (FN) and laminin containing ECM in the early zebrafish embryo. This matrix was first detected at early gastrulation (65{\%} epiboly) in the form of punctae that localize to tissue boundaries separating germ layers from each other and the underlying yolk cell. Fibrillogenesis increased after mid-gastrulation (80{\%} epiboly) coinciding with the period of planar cell polarity pathway-dependent convergence and extension cell movements. We demonstrate that FN fibrils present beneath deep mesodermal cells are aligned in the direction of membrane protrusion formation. Utilizing antisense morpholino oligonucleotides, we further show that knockdown of FN expression causes a convergence and extension defect. Taken together, our data show that similar to amphibian embryos, the formation of ECM in the zebrafish gastrula is a dynamic process that occurs in parallel to at least a portion of the polarized cell behaviors shaping the embryonic body plan. These results provide a framework for uncovering the interrelationship between ECM structure and cellular processes regulating convergence and extension such as directed migration and mediolateral/radial intercalation. ?? 2009 International Society of Matrix Biology.},

abstract = {Uncovering mechanisms that control the dynamics of microtubules is fundamental for our understanding of multiple cellular processes such as chromosome separation and cell motility. Building on previous theoretical work on the dynamic instability of microtubules, we propose here a stochastic model that includes all relevant biochemical processes that affect the dynamics of microtubule plus-end, namely, the binding of GTP-bound monomers, unbinding of GTP- and GDP-bound monomers, and hydrolysis of GTP monomers. The inclusion of dissociation processes, present in our approach but absent from many previous studies, is essential to guarantee the thermodynamic consistency of the model. Our theoretical method allows us to compute all dynamic properties of microtubules explicitly. Using experimentally determined rates, it is found that the cap size is ∼3.6 layers, an estimate that is compatible with several experimental observations. In the end, our model provides a comprehensive description of the dynamic instability of microtubules that includes not only the statistics of catastrophes but also the statistics of rescues. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biophysical Society.},

It is finely regulated by hundreds of different types of microtubule-associated proteins and molecular motors whose specific functions are difficult to investigate directly in cells. Here, we have investigated their functions using geometrically controlled MT networks in vitro in cell-free assay. This was achieved by developing a new method to spatially define MT nucleation using MT microseeds adsorbed on a micropatterned glass substrate. This method could be used to control MT growth and the induction of complex MT networks. We selected the interaction of two radial arrays of dynamic and polarized MTs to analyze the formation of the central antiparallel MT bundle. We investigated the effects of the MT cross-linker anaphase spindle elongation 1 (Ase1) and the kinesin motor Klp2, which are known to regulate MT organization in the spindle midzone. We thus identified the respective roles of each protein and revealed their synergy on the establishment of stable antiparallel MT bundles by quantifying MT interactions over hundreds of comparable MT networks.},

abstract = {In early mitosis, microtubules can be generated at kinetochores as well as at spindle poles. However, the role and regulation of kinetochore-derived microtubules have been unclear. In general, metaphase spindle microtubules are oriented such that their plus ends bind to kinetochores. However, we now have evidence that, during early mitosis in budding yeast, microtubules are generated at kinetochores with distal plus ends. These kinetochore-derived microtubules interact along their length with microtubules that extend from a spindle pole, facilitating kinetochore loading onto the lateral surface of spindle pole microtubules. Once kinetochores are loaded, microtubules are no longer generated at kinetochores, and those that remain disappear rapidly and do not contribute to the metaphase spindle. Stu2 (the ortholog of vertebrate XMAP215/ch-TOG) localizes to kinetochores and plays a central role in regulating kinetochore-derived microtubules. Our work provides insight into microtubule generation at kinetochores and the mechanisms that facilitate initial kinetochore interaction with spindle pole microtubules. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The chromosome passenger complex (CPC) must relocate from anaphase chromosomes to the cell equator for successful cytokinesis. Although this landmark event requires the mitotic kinesin MKlp2, the spatiotemporal mechanistic basis remains elusive. Here, we show that phosphoregulation of MKlp2 by the mitotic kinase Cdk1/cyclin B1 coordinates proper mitotic transition with CPC relocation. We identified multiple Cdk1/cyclin B1 phosphorylation sites within the stalk and C-terminal tail that inhibit microtubule binding and bundling, oligomerization/clustering, and chromosome targeting ofMKlp2. Specifically, inhibition of these abilities byCdk1/cyclin B1 phosphorylation is essential for proper early mitotic progression. Upon anaphase onset, however, reversal of Cdk1/cyclin B1 phosphorylation promotes MKlp2-CPC complex formation and relocates the CPC from anaphase chromosomes for successful cytokinesis. Thus, we propose that phosphoregulation of MKlp2 by Cdk1/cyclin B1ensures that activation of MKlp2 kinesin and relocation of the CPC occur at the appropriate time and space for proper mitotic progression and genomic stability. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

Two features of the nascent transcript correlated with RNAPI distribution: folding energy and GC content in the transcription bubble. In vitro experiments confirmed that strong RNA structures close to the polymerase promote forward translocation and limit backtracking, whereas high GC in the transcription bubble slows elongation. A mathematical model for RNAPI elongation confirmed the importance of nascent RNA folding in transcription. RNAPI from S. pombe was similarly sensitive to transcript folding, as were S. cerevisiae RNAPII and RNAPIII. For RNAPII, unstructured RNA, which favors slowed elongation, was associated with faster cotranscriptional splicing and proximal splice site use, indicating regulatory significance for transcript folding.},

We show that, during anaphase B, Imp1-mediated transport of the AAA-ATPase Cdc48 protein at the MMD allows this disassembly factor to localize at the spindle midzone, thereby promoting spindle midzone dissolution.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Physical Society. During cell division, sister chromatids are segregated by the mitotic spindle, a bipolar assembly of interdigitating antiparallel polar filaments called microtubules. The spindle contains the midzone, a stable region of overlapping antiparallel microtubules, that is essential for maintaining bipolarity. Although a lot is known about the molecular players involved, the mechanism underlying midzone formation and maintenance is still poorly understood. We study the interaction of polar filaments that are cross-linked by molecular motors moving directionally and by passive cross-linkers diffusing along microtubules. Using a particle-based stochastic model, we find that the interplay of motors and passive cross-linkers can generate a stable finite overlap between a pair of antiparallel polar filaments. We develop a mean-field theory to study this mechanism in detail and investigate the influence of steric interactions between motors and passive cross-linkers on the overlap dynamics. In the presence of interspecies steric interactions, passive cross-linkers mimic the behavior of molecular motors and stable finite overlaps are generated even for non-cross-linking motors. Finally, we develop a mean-field theory for a bundle of aligned polar filaments and show that they can self-organize into a spindlelike pattern. Our work suggests possible ways as to how cells can generate spindle midzones and control their extensions.},

Here, we combine optical trapping with TIRF-based microscopy to measure the force dependence of microtubule interaction for three nonmotor MAPs (NuMA, PRC1, and EB1) required for cell division. We find that frictional forces increase nonlinearly with MAP velocity across microtubules and depend on filament polarity, with NuMA's friction being lower when moving toward minus ends, EB1's lower toward plus ends, and PRC1's exhibiting no directional preference. Mathematical models predict, and experiments confirm, that MAPs with asymmetric friction can move directionally within actively moving microtubule pairs they crosslink.

HSET is also thought to antagonize plus-end-directed kinesin-5 Eg5 to balance spindle forces [4, 5, 7, 9]. However, the biomechanics of this force opposition are unclear, as HSET has previously been defined as a non-processive motor [10–16]. Here, we use optical trapping to elucidate the mechanism of force generation by HSET. We show that a single HSET motor has a processive nature with the ability to complete multiple steps while trapped along a microtubule and when unloaded can move in both directions for microns. Compared to other kinesins, HSET has a relatively weak stall force of 1.1 pN [17, 18]. Moreover, HSET's tail domain and its interaction with the E-hook of tubulin are necessary for long-range motility. In vitro polarity-marked bundle assays revealed that HSET selectively generates force in anti-parallel bundles on the order of its stall force. When combined with varied ratios of Eg5, HSET adopts Eg5's directionality while acting as an antagonizing force brake, requiring at least a 10-fold higher Eg5 concentration to surpass HSET's sliding force. These results reveal HSET's ability to change roles within the spindle from acting as an adjustable microtubule slider and force regulator to a processive motor that aids in minus end focusing.},

abstract = {The plus ends of microtubules have been speculated to regulate the actin cytoskeleton for the proper positioning of sites of cell polarization and cytokinesis. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, interphase microtubules and the kelch repeat protein tea1p regulate polarized cell growth. Here, we show that tea1p is directly deposited at cell tips by microtubule plus ends. Tea1p associates in large "polarisome" complexes with bud6p and for3p, a formin that assembles actin cables. Tea1p also interacts in a separate complex with the CLIP-170 protein tip1p, a microtubule plus end-binding protein that anchors tea1p to the microtubule plus end. Localization experiments suggest that tea1p and bud6p regulate formin distribution and actin cable assembly. Although single mutants still polarize, for3$\Delta$bud6$\Delta$tea1$\Delta$ triple-mutant cells lack polarity, indicating that these proteins contribute overlapping functions in cell polarization. Thus, these experiments begin to elucidate how microtubules contribute to the proper spatial regulation of actin assembly and polarized cell growth.},

Some of these motors exhibit off-axis power strokes, but their impact on motility and force generation in microtubule overlaps has not been investigated. Here, we develop and utilize a three-dimensional in vitro motility assay to explore kinesin-14, Ncd, driven sliding of cross-linked microtubules. We observe that free microtubules, sliding on suspended microtubules, not only rotate around their own axis but also move around the suspended microtubules with right-handed helical trajectories. Importantly, the associated torque is large enough to cause microtubule twisting and coiling. Further, our technique allows us to measure the in situ spatial extension of the motors between cross-linked microtubules to be about 20 nm. We argue that the capability of microtubule-crosslinking kinesins to cause helical motion of overlapping microtubules around each other allows for flexible filament organization, roadblock circumvention and torque generation in the mitotic spindle.},

Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CMG2 lead to a severe condition, hyaline fibromatosis syndrome (HFS). We have here dissected a network of dynamic interactions between CMG2 and various actin interactors and regulators, describing a different behavior from other extracellular matrix receptors. CMG2 binds talin, and thereby the actin cytoskeleton, only in its ligand-free state. Extracellular ligand binding leads to src-dependent talin release and recruitment of the actin cytoskeleton regulator RhoA and its effectors. These sequential interactions of CMG2 are necessary for the control of oriented cell division during fish development. Finally, we demonstrate that effective switching between talin and RhoA binding is required for the intracellular degradation of collagen VI in human fibroblasts, which explains why HFS mutations in the cytoskeleton-binding domain lead to dysregulation of extracellular matrix homeostasis.},

Cytoplasmic $\gamma$-tubulin complexes are targeted to centrosomes or to other microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) via a set of so called $\gamma$-tubulin complex binding proteins (GTBPs) that probably interact with the conserved Spc97p/Spc98p protein family of $\gamma$-tubulin complexes. In other cell types, $\gamma$-tubulin complexes may initiate microtubule formation near chromosomes in a MTOC-independent manner. Recently, major advances have been achieved through the finding that $\gamma$-tubulin, Spc97p and Spc98p form a conserved core that is probably responsible for microtubule nucleation, and by the discovery that a yeast GTBP is regulated in a cell-cycle-dependent manner and in response to an external signal. Furthermore, it was found that the small GTPase Ran in its GDP-bound state may promote spindle assembly. In addition, an essential function of $\gamma$-tubulin in basal body duplication has been demonstrated in Paramecium.},

Using electron microscopy (EM) and high-resolution surface shadowing we have studied the microtubule-binding properties of the fission yeast EB1 homolog Mal3p. This allowed for a direct visualization of Mal3p bound on the surface of microtubules. Mal3p particles usually formed a single line on each microtubule along just one of the multiple grooves that are formed by adjacent protofilaments. We provide structural data showing that the alignment of Mal3p molecules coincides with the microtubule lattice seam as well as data suggesting that Mal3p not only binds but also stabilizes this seam. Accordingly, Mal3p stabilizes microtubules through a specific interaction with what is potentially the weakest part of the microtubule in a way not previously demonstrated. Our findings further suggest that microtubules exhibit two distinct reaction platforms on their surface that can independently interact with target structures such as microtubule-associated proteins, motors, kinetochores, or membranes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The molecular basis of microtubule dynamic instability is controversial, but is thought to be related to a 'GTP cap'. A key prediction of the GTP cap model is that the proposed labile GDP-tubulin core will rapidly dissociate if the GTP-tubulin cap is lost. We have tested this prediction by using a UV microbeam to cut the ends from elongating microtubules. Phosphocellulose-purified tubulin was assembled onto the plus and minus ends of sea urchin flagellar axoneme fragments at 21-22°C. The assembly dynamics of individual mirotubules were recorded in real time using video microscopy. When the tip of an elongating plus end microtubule was cut off, the severed plus end microtubule always rapidly shortened back to the axoneme at the normal plus end rate. However, when the distal tip of an elongating minus and microtubule was cut off, no rapid shortening occurred. Instead, the severed minus end resumed elongation at the normal minus end rate. Our results show that some form of 'stabilizing cap', possibly a GTP cap, governs the transition (catastrophe) from elongation to rapid shortening at the plus end. At the minus end, a simple GTP cap is not sufficient to explain the observed behavior unless UV induces immediate recapping of minus, but not plus, ends. Another possibility is that a second step, perhaps a structural transformation, is required in addition to GTP cap loss for rapid shortening to occur. This transformation would be favored at plus, but not minus ends, to account for the asymmetric behavior of the ends.},

Our data indicate that iMT plus‐end dynamics are regulated during mitosis, as fluorescence recovery was faster in intermediate anaphase (30 s) compared with long (100 s) and pre‐anaphase (80 s) spindles. We also observed that deletion of Cin8, a microtubule‐crosslinking kinesin‐5 motor protein, reduced the recovery rate in anaphase spindles, indicating that Cin8 contributes to the destabilization of iMT plus‐ends. Finally, we show that in cells lacking the midzone organizing protein Ase1, iMTs are highly dynamic and are exchangeable throughout most of their length, indicating that midzone organization is essential for restricting iMT dynamics.},

abstract = {The temporal-headway distribution for Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) with random-sequential update is investigated. Considering the stationary/steady state of the process, exact formula for the step-headway distribution is derived for conditions when the stationary measure is Bernoulli, i.e., for periodic boundaries and for open boundaries with entering boundary rate $\alpha$ and leaving boundary rate $\beta$ satisfying $\alpha$+$\beta$=1. The step-headway formula for general values of boundary rates is calculated numerically by means of the matrix product ansatz. The formula is applicable mainly for the model defined on finite small lattice representing short segment of complex network. In this case the dependency of the motion of individual particles is noticeable and cannot be neglected. The finite lattice results are compared to continuous time distribution obtained by means of the large L limit. It can be observed that the scaled distribution converges quite fast to continuous time distribution. However, in the case of rather small lattice the distribution significantly differs from the limiting one. Moreover, in the case of Bernoulli stationary measure, the distribution is not dependent on the position of the reference site on the lattice. Considering general values of boundary parameters, the shape of the distribution is influenced by the density profile of the process near boundaries. This influence vanishes with increasing lattice size.},

Here we present two structures corresponding to the start and end points in the microtubule polymerization and hydrolysis cycles that illustrate the consequences of nucleotide state on longitudinal and lateral assembly. In the absence of depolymerizers, GDP-bound tubulin shows distinctive intra-dimer and inter-dimer interactions and thus distinguishes the GTP and GDP interfaces. A cold-stable tubulin polymer with the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GMPCPP, containing semi-conserved lateral interactions, supports a model in which the straightening of longitudinal interfaces happens sequentially, starting with a conformational change after GTP binding that straightens the dimer enough for the formation of lateral contacts into a non-tubular intermediate.

Anatomical abnormalities underlying brain dysfunctions in IGE are unclear and their relation to the pathomechanisms of epileptogenesis is poorly understood. In this study, we applied connectometry, an advanced quantitative neuroimaging technique for investigating localised changes in white-matter tissues in vivo. Analysing white matter structures of 32 subjects we incorporated our in vivo findings in a computational model of seizure dynamics to suggest a plausible mechanism of epileptogenesis. Patients with IGE have significant bilateral alterations in major white-matter fascicles. In the cingulum, fornix, and superior longitudinal fasciculus, tract integrity is compromised, whereas in specific parts of tracts between thalamus and the precentral gyrus, tract integrity is enhanced in patients. Combining these alterations in a logistic regression model, we computed the decision boundary that discriminated patients and controls. The computational model, informed with the findings on the tract abnormalities, specifically highlighted the importance of enhanced cortico-reticular connections along with impaired cortico-cortical connections in inducing pathological seizure-like dynamics. We emphasise taking directionality of brain connectivity into consideration towards understanding the pathological mechanisms; this is possible by combining neuroimaging and computational modelling. Our imaging evidence of structural alterations suggest the loss of cortico-cortical and enhancement of cortico-thalamic fibre integrity in IGE. We further suggest that impaired connectivity from cortical regions to the thalamic reticular nucleus offers a therapeutic target for selectively modifying the brain circuit for reversing the mechanisms leading to epileptogenesis.},

Here we show that epithelial cells, hard-wired to maintain a static morphology and to preserve tissue organization, can spontaneously switch to a migratory polarized phenotype after relaxation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton. We find that myosin II engages actin in the formation of cortical actomyosin bundles and thus makes it unavailable for deployment in the process of dendritic growth normally driving cell motility. Under low-contractility regimes, epithelial cells polarize in a front-back manner owing to the emergence of actin retrograde flows powered by dendritic polymerization of actin. Coupled to cell movement, the flows transport myosin II from the front to the back of the cell, where the motor locally 'locks' actin in contractile bundles. This polarization mechanism could be employed by embryonic and cancer epithelial cells in microenvironments where high-contractility-driven cell motion is inefficient.},

The lateral fluidity of these membranes allows ligand receptor complexes to assemble into oligomers and higher order clusters. This type of higher order clustering has been shown to play a role in the regulation and function of various cell membrane receptors. In order to study complex, multicomponent signaling assemblies, I have extended the use of supported membranes and DNA-based protein assembly to form heterodimers of signaling molecules. Characterization of these structures was performed by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy, which confirmed their lateral mobility and the formation of specific heterodimers. I have additionally demonstrated the interaction of these structures with live cells and the modulation of signaling cluster content in these cells. DNA based assembly was also used for the precise positioning of fluorophores at a fixed distance from a gold nanoparticle encased in a viral capsid. These fluorophores were protected from contact quenching, and their fluorescence was enhanced by their proximity to the gold nanoparticle. Together these studies demonstrate the use of DNA hybridization in directing the formation of functional nanoscale assemblies.},

Key to these functions is the fact that microtubules are “dynamic.” As with actin, the polymer dynamics are driven by nucleotide hydrolysis and influenced by a host of specialized regulatory proteins, including microtubule-associated proteins. However, microtubule turnover involves a surprising behavior—termed dynamic instability—in which individual polymers switch stochastically between growth and depolymerization. Dynamic instability allows microtubules to explore intracellular space and remodel in response to intracellular and extracellular cues. Here, we reviewhowsuch instability is central to the assembly of many microtubule-based structures and to the robust functioning of the microtubule cytoskeleton.},

abstract = {Higher-order structures of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton are comprised of two architectures: bundles and asters. Although both architectures are critical for cellular function, the molecular pathways that drive aster formation are poorly understood. Here, we study aster formation by human minus-end-directed kinesin-14 (HSET/KIFC1). We show that HSET is incapable of forming asters from preformed, nongrowing MTs, but rapidly forms MT asters in the presence of soluble (non-MT) tubulin. HSET binds soluble (non-MT) tubulin via its N-terminal tail domain to form heterogeneous HSET-tubulin clusters containing multiple motors. Cluster formation induces motor processivity and rescues the formation of asters from nongrowing MTs. We then show that excess soluble (non-MT) tubulin stimulates aster formation in HeLa cells overexpressing HSET during mitosis. We propose a model where HSET can toggle between MT bundle and aster formation in a manner governed by the availability of soluble (non-MT) tubulin.},

abstract = {Remodelling of the nuclear membrane is essential for the dynamic changes of nuclear architecture at different stages of the cell cycle and during cell differentiation. The molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of nuclear membrane biogenesis is not known. Here we show that Smp2, the yeast homologue of mammalian lipin, is a key regulator of nuclear membrane growth during the cell cycle. Smp2 is phosphorylated by Cdc28/Cdk1 and dephosphorylated by a nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-localized CPD phosphatase complex consisting of Nem1 and Spo7. Loss of either SMP2 or its dephosphorylated form causes transcriptional upregulation of key enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis concurrent with a massive expansion of the nucleus. Conversely, constitutive dephosphorylation of Smp2 inhibits cell division. We show that Smp2 associates with the promoters of phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes in a Nem1-Spo7-dependent manner. Our data suggest that Smp2 is a critical factor in coordinating phospholipid biosynthesis at the nuclear/ER membrane with nuclear growth during the cell cycle. {\textcopyright} 2005 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.},

abstract = {Anthrax toxin is released from Bacillus anthracis as three monomeric proteins, which assemble into toxic complexes at the surface of receptor-bearing host cells. One of the proteins, protective antigen (PA), binds to receptors and orchestrates the delivery of the other two (the lethal and edema factors) into the cytosol. PA has been shown to bind to two cellular receptors: anthrax toxin receptor/tumor endothelial marker 8 and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2). Both are type 1 membrane proteins that include an approximately 200-aa extracellular von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain with a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif. The anthrax toxin receptor/tumor endothelial marker 8 and CMG2 VWA domains share approximately 60{\%} amino acid identity and bind PA directly in a metal-dependent manner. Here, we report the crystal structure of the CMG2 VWA domain, with and without its intramolecular disulfide bond, to 1.5 and 1.8 A, respectively. Both structures contain a carboxylate ligand-mimetic bound at the MIDAS and appear as open conformations when compared with the VWA domains from alpha-integrins. The CMG2 structures provide a template to begin probing the high-affinity CMG2-PA interaction (200 pM) and may facilitate understanding of toxin assembly/internalization and the development of new anthrax treatments. The structural data also allow molecular interpretation of known CMG2 VWA domain mutations linked to the genetic disorders, juvenile hyaline fibromatosis, and infantile systemic hyalinosis.},

abstract = {Different organisms employ a variety of strategies to segregate their chromosomes during mitosis. Despite these differences, however, the basic regulatory principles that govern this intricate process are evolutionarily conserved. Above all, rapid dephosphorylation of mitotic phosphoproteins upon the metaphase-to-anaphase transition has proven to be essential for proper function of the mitotic spindle and accurate chromosome segregation in all eukaryotes. recently, a central midzone component, the microtubule crosslinker Ase1/PrC1 (anaphase spindle elongation 1/protein regulating cytokinesis 1), was uncovered as a universal target of such control mechanism. Depending on its phosphorylation status, Ase1 either restrains spindle elongation in metaphase or promotes it after anaphase onset via recruitment of kinesin motor proteins to the midzone. Here we discuss the potential role of Ase1/PrC1 as a central regulatory platform that interconnects distinct functions of the midzone such as spindle stability, spindle elongation and cytokinesis. Additionally, we provide a comparative overview of the chromosome segregation strategies used by the main model organisms. {\textcopyright} 2010 Landes Bioscience.},

We identified the kinesin-13 kif2a as a driver of developmental spindle scaling whose microtubule-destabilizing activity is inhibited in stage 3 spindles by the transport receptor importin $\alpha$, and activated in stage 8 when importin $\alpha$ partitions to a membrane pool. Altering spindle size in developing embryos impaired spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remained robust. Thus, spindle size in Xenopus development is coupled to cell size through a ratiometric mechanism controlling microtubule destabilization. {\textcopyright} Wilbur et al.},

The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) monitors this process, generating a {\^{a}} € wait anaphase'signal at unattached kinetochores of misaligned chromosomes. However, the link between SAC activation and chromosome alignment is poorly understood. Here we show that Mad1, a core SAC component, plays a hitherto concealed role in chromosome alignment. Protein-protein interaction screening revealed that fission yeast Mad1 binds the plus-end-directed kinesin-5 motor protein Cut7 (Eg5 homologue), which is generally thought to promote spindle bipolarity. We demonstrate that Mad1 recruits Cut7 to kinetochores of misaligned chromosomes and promotes chromosome gliding towards the spindle equator. Similarly, human Mad1 recruits another kinetochore motor CENP-E, revealing that Mad1 is the conserved dual-function protein acting in SAC activation and chromosome gliding. Our results suggest that the mitotic checkpoint has co-evolved with a mechanism to drive chromosome congression.},

Microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) associate with growing microtubule plus ends and control microtubule dynamics and interactions with different cellular structures during cell division, migration, and morphogenesis. EB1 and its homologs are highly conserved proteins that play an important role in the targeting of +TIPs to microtubule ends, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. By using live cell experiments and in vitro reconstitution assays, we demonstrate that a short polypeptide motif, Ser-x-Ile-Pro (SxIP), is used by numerous +TIPs, including the tumor suppressor APC, the transmembrane protein STIM1, and the kinesin MCAK, for localization to microtubule tips in an EB1-dependent manner. Structural and biochemical data reveal the molecular basis of the EB1-SxIP interaction and explain its negative regulation by phosphorylation.

abstract = {Recently, we have shown that a cancer causing truncation in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (APC1-1450) dominantly interferes with mitotic spindle function, suggesting APC regulates microtubule dynamics during mitosis. Here, we examine the possibility that APC mutants interfere with the function of EB1, a plus-end microtubule-binding protein that interacts with APC and is required for normal microtubule dynamics. We show that siRNA-mediated inhibition of APC, EB1, or APC and EB1 together give rise to similar defects in mitotic spindles and chromosome alignment without arresting cells in mitosis; in contrast inhibition of CLIP170 or LIS1 cause distinct spindle defects and mitotic arrest. We show that APC1-1450 acts as a dominant negative by forming a hetero-oligomer with the full-length APC and preventing it from interacting with EB1, which is consistent with a functional relationship between APC and EB1. Live-imaging of mitotic cells expressing EB1-GFP demonstrates that APC1-1450 compromises the dynamics of EB1-comets, increasing the frequency of EB1-GFP pausing. Together these data provide novel insight into how APC may regulate mitotic spindle function and how errors in chromosome segregation are tolerated in tumor cells. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The American Society for Cell Biology.},

@article{Chen2019,
abstract = {Besides sliding apart antiparallel microtubules during spindle elongation, the mitotic kinesin-5, Eg5, promotes microtubule polymerization, emphasizing its importance in mitotic spindle length control. Here, we characterize the Eg5 microtubule polymerase mechanism by assessing motor-induced changes in the longitudinal and lateral tubulin-tubulin bonds that form the microtubule lattice. Isolated Eg5 motor domains promote microtubule nucleation, growth, and stability; thus, crosslinking tubulin by pairs of motor heads is not necessary for polymerase activity. Eg5 binds preferentially to microtubules over free tubulin, which contrasts with microtubule-depolymerizing kinesins that preferentially bind free tubulin over microtubules. Colchicine-like inhibitors that stabilize the bent conformation of tubulin allosterically inhibit Eg5 binding, consistent with a model in which Eg5 induces a curved-to-straight transition in tubulin. Domain swap experiments establish that the family-specific loop11-helix 4 junction, which resides near the nucleotide-sensing switch-II domain, is necessary and sufficient for the polymerase activity of Eg5. Thus, we propose a microtubule polymerase mechanism in which Eg5 at the plus-end promotes a curved-to-straight transition in tubulin that enhances lateral bond formation and thereby promotes microtubule growth and stability. One implication is that regulation of Eg5 motile properties by regulatory proteins or small molecule inhibitors could also have effects on intracellular microtubule dynamics. Mitotic kinesin-5 (Eg5) motors promote microtubule polymerization through an unknown mechanism. Chen et al. propose a model in which Eg5 binding to tubulin promotes a curved-to-straight transition that drives microtubule assembly. During mitosis, this polymerase activity may enhance spindle formation and stability and drive poleward flux.},

In metaphase, chromosomes are aligned on the spindle with sister kinetochores facing toward the opposite poles. In anaphase A, sister chromatids separate from each other without spindle extension, whereas spindle elongation takes place during anaphase B. We have critically examined whether such mitotic stages also occur in a lower eukaryote, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Using the green fluorescent protein tagging technique, early mitotic to late anaphase events were observed in living fission yeast cells. S. pombe has three phases in spindle dynamics, spindle formation (phase 1), constant spindle length (phase 2), and spindle extension (phase 3). Sister centromere separation (anaphase A) rapidly occurred at the end of phase 2. The centromere showed dynamic movements throughout phase 2 as it moved back and forth and was transiently split in two before its separation, suggesting that the centromere was positioned in a bioriented manner toward the poles at metaphase. Microtubule-associating Dis1 was required for the occurrence of constant spindle length and centromere movement in phase 2. Normal transition from phase 2 to 3 needed DNA topoisomerase II and Cut1 but not Cut14. The duration of each phase was highly dependent on temperature.},

We found that kinesin-5 is upregulated in this malignant clone, and weak inhibition of kinesin-5 activity could revert the spindle to a smaller aspect ratio, decrease the speed of spindle pole separation, and suppress post-mitotic cell migration. A correlation was found between high aspect ratio and strong metastatic potential in cancers that evolved and were selected in vivo, implicating that the spindle aspect ratio could serve as a promising cellular biomarker for metastatic cancer clones.},

Cells in the posterior two thirds of the embryo move in two striking counter-rotating flows that meet at the site of streak formation at the posterior end of the embryo. Cells divide during this rotational movement with a cell cycle time of 6-7 h. Daughter cells remain together, forming small clusters and as result of the flow patterns line up in the streak. Expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, P21/Waf inhibits cell division and severely limits embryo growth, but does not inhibit streak formation or associated flows. To investigate the role off cell-cell intercalation in streak formation we have inhibited the Wnt planar-polarity signalling pathway by expression of a dominant negative Wnt11 and a Dishevelled mutant Xdd1. Both treatments do not result in an inhibition of streak formation, but both severely affect extension of the embryo in later development. Likewise inhibition of myosin II which as been shown to drive cell-cell intercalation during Drosophila germ band extension, has no effect on streak formation, but also effectively blocks elongation after regression has started. These experiments make it unlikely that streak formation involves known cell-cell intercalation mechanisms. Expression of a dominant negative FGFR1c receptor construct as well as the soluble extracellular domain of the FGFR1c receptor both effectively block the cell movements associated with streak formation and mesoderm differentiation, showing the importance of FGF signalling in these processes.},

abstract = {Alignment of the mitotic spindle with the axis of cell division is an essential process in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is mediated by interactions between cytoplasmic microtubules and the cell cortex. We found that a cortical protein, the yeast formin Bni1p, was required for spindle orientation. Two striking abnormalities were observed in bni1Delta cells. First, the initial movement of the spindle pole body (SPB) toward the emerging bud was defective. This phenotype is similar to that previously observed in cells lacking the kinesin Kip3p and, in fact, BNI1 and KIP3 were found to be in the same genetic pathway. Second, abnormal pulling interactions between microtubules and the cortex appeared to cause preanaphase spindles in bni1Delta cells to transit back and forth between the mother and the bud. We therefore propose that Bni1p may localize or alter the function of cortical microtubule-binding sites in the bud. Additionally, we present evidence that other bipolar bud site determinants together with cortical actin are also required for spindle orientation.},

abstract = {The centrosomal pericentrin-related proteins play pivotal roles in various aspects of cell division; however their underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here we show that fission-yeast pericentrin-like Pcp1 regulates multiple functions of the spindle pole body (SPB) through recruiting two critical factors, the c-tubulin complex (c-TuC) and polo kinase (Plo1). We isolated two pcp1 mutants (pcp1-15 and pcp1-18) that display similar abnormal spindles, but with remarkably different molecular defects. Both mutants exhibit defective monopolar spindle microtubules that emanate from the mother SPB. However, while pcp1-15 fails to localise the c-TuC to the mitotic SPB, pcp1-18 is specifically defective in recruiting Plo1. Consistently Pcp1 forms a complex with both c-TuC and Plo1 in the cell. pcp1-18 is further defective in the mitoticspecific reorganisation of the nuclear envelope (NE), leading to impairment of SPB insertion into the NE. Moreover pcp1-18, but not pcp1-15, is rescued by overproducing nuclear pore components or advancing mitotic onset. The central role for Pcp1 in orchestrating these processes provides mechanistic insight into how the centrosome regulates multiple cellular pathways. {\textcopyright} 2010 European Molecular Biology Organization.},

abstract = {During vertebrate gastrulation, convergence and extension (C{\&}E) movements narrow and lengthen the embryonic tissues, respectively. In zebrafish, regional differences of C{\&}E movements have been observed; however, the underlying cell behaviors are poorly understood. Using time-lapse analyses and computational modeling, we demonstrate that C{\&}E of the medial presomitic mesoderm is achieved by cooperation of planar and radial cell intercalations. Radial intercalations preferentially separate anterior and posterior neighbors to promote extension. In knypek;trilobite noncanonical Wnt mutants, the frequencies of cell intercalations are altered and the anteroposterior bias of radial intercalations is lost. This provides evidence for noncanonical Wnt signaling polarizing cell movements between different mesodermal cell layers. We further show using fluorescent fusion proteins that during dorsal mesoderm C{\&}E, the noncanonical Wnt component Prickle localizes at the anterior cell edge, whereas Dishevelled is enriched posteriorly. Asymmetrical localization of Prickle and Dishevelled to the opposite cell edges in zebrafish gastrula parallels their distribution in fly, and suggests that noncanonical Wnt signaling defines distinct anterior and posterior cell properties to bias cell intercalations.},

abstract = {We examined spindle elongation in anaphase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells mutated for the kinesin-5 motor proteins Cin8 and Kip1. Cells were deleted for KIP1 and/or expressed one of two motor-domain Cin8 mutants (Cin8-F467A or Cin8-R196K, which differ in their ability to bind microtubules in vitro, with Cin8-F467A having the weakest ability). We found that, in kinesin-5-mutated cells, predominantly in kip1$\Delta$cin8-F467A cells, anaphase spindle elongation was frequently interrupted after the fast phase, resulting in a mid-anaphase pause. Expression of kinesin-5 mutants also caused an asymmetric midzone location and enlarged midzone size, suggesting that proper organization of the midzone is required for continuous spindle elongation. We also examined the effects of components of the FEAR pathway, which is involved in the early-anaphase activation of Cdc14 regulatory phosphatase, on anaphase spindle elongation in kip1$\Delta$cin8-F467A cells. Deletion of SLK19, but not SP012, eliminated the mid-anaphase pause, caused premature anaphase onset and defects in DNA division during anaphase, and reduced viability in these cells. Finally, overriding of the pre-anaphase checkpoint by overexpression of Cdc20 also eliminated the mid-anaphase pause and caused DNA deformation during anaphase in kip1$\Delta$cin8-F467A cells. We propose that transient activation of the pre-anaphase checkpoint in kinesin-5-mutated cells induces a SIk19-dependent mid-anaphase pause, which might be important for proper DNA segregation.},

abstract = {Background. Polo-like kinases control multiple events during cell division, including mitotic entry, centrosome organization, spindle formation, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. Their roles during cytokinesis, however, are not well understood because the requirement of these kinases during early stages of mitosis complicates the study of their functions after anaphase onset. Methodology/Principal Findings. We used time-lapse microscopy to analyze the dynamics of Polo::GFP in Drosophila tissue culture cells during mitosis. After anaphase onset, Polo::GFP concentrated at the spindle-midzone, but also diffused along the entire length of the central spindle. Using RNA interference we demonstrate that the microtubule-associated proteins Feo and Klp3A are required for Polo recruitment to the spindle midzone but not the kinesin Pavarotti as previously thought. Moreover, we show that Feo and Klp3A form a complex and that Polo co-localizes with both proteins. during cytokinesis. Conclusion/Significance. Our results reveal that the Feo/Klp3A complex is necessary for Polo recruitment to the spindle midzone. A similar finding has also been recently reported in mammalian cells [1], suggesting that this basic mechanism has been conserved during evolution, albeit with some difference. Finally since cleavage furrow formation and ingression are unaffected following feo RNAI, our data imply that Polo recruitment to the central spindle is not required for furrowing, but some other aspect of cytokinesis. {\textcopyright} 2007 D'Avino-et al.},

abstract = {Microtubule network remodeling is essential for fundamental cellular processes including cell division, differentiation, and motility. Microtubules are active biological polymers whose ends stochastically and independently switch between phases of growth and shrinkage. Microtubule treadmilling, in which the microtubule plus end grows while the minus end shrinks, is observed in cells; however, the underlying mechanisms are not known. Here, we use a combination of computational and in vitro reconstitution approaches to determine the conditions leading to robust microtubule treadmilling. We find that microtubules polymerized from tubulin alone can treadmill, albeit with opposite directionality and order-of-magnitude slower rates than observed in cells. We then employ computational simulations to predict that the combinatory effects of four microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), namely EB1, XMAP215, CLASP2, and MCAK, can promote fast and sustained plus-end-leading treadmilling. Finally, we experimentally confirm the predictions of our computational model using a multi-MAP, in vitro microtubule dynamics assay to reconstitute robust plus-end-leading treadmilling, consistent with observations in cells. Our results demonstrate how microtubule dynamics can be modulated to achieve a dynamic balance between assembly and disassembly at opposite polymer ends, resulting in treadmilling over long periods of time. Overall, we show how the collective effects of multiple components give rise to complex microtubule behavior that may be used for global network remodeling in cells.},

Using in vitro reconstitution experiments and computer simulations, we show that the human mitotic motors kinesin-5 KIF11 and kinesin-14 HSET, despite opposite directionalities, can both organize dynamic microtubules into either polar or nematic networks. We show that in addition to the motor properties the natural asymmetry between microtubule plus- and minus-end growth critically contributes to the organizational potential of the motors. We identify two control parameters that capture system composition and kinetic properties and predict the outcome of microtubule network organization.

This complex is composed of a catalytic subunit, Aurora B kinase, and three nonenzymatic subunits, INCENP, Survivin, and Borealin. Together, these four subunits interdependently regulate CPC function, and they are highly conserved among eukaryotes. However, a Borealin homologue has never been characterized in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here, we isolate a previously uncharacterized S. pombe protein through association with the Cdc14 phosphatase homologue, Clp1/Flp1, and identify it as a Borealin-like member of the CPC. Nbl1 (novel Borealin-like 1) physically associates with known CPC components, affects the kinase activity and stability of the S. pombe Aurora B homologue, Ark1, colocalizes with known CPC subunits during mitosis, and shows sequence similarity to human Borealin. Further analysis of the Clp1-Nbl1 interaction indicates that Clp1 requires CPC activity for proper accumulation at the contractile ring (CR). Consistent with this, we describe negative genetic interactions between mutant alleles of CPC and CR components. Thus, this study characterizes a fission yeast Borealin homologue and reveals a previously unrecognized connection between the CPC and the process of cytokinesis in S. pombe. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The American Society for Cell Biology.},

The spindle accomplishes its function using forces generated by microtubules (MTs) and multiple molecular motors, but how these forces are integrated remains unclear, since the temporal activation profiles and the mechanical characteristics of the relevant motors are largely unknown. Here, we developed a computational search algorithm that uses experimental measurements to 'reverse engineer' molecular mechanical machines. Our algorithm uses measurements of length time series for wild-type and experimentally perturbed spindles to identify mechanistic models for coordination of the mitotic force generators in Drosophila embryo spindles. The search eliminated thousands of possible models and identified six distinct strategies for MT-motor integration that agree with available data. Many features of these six predicted strategies are conserved, including a persistent kinesin-5-driven sliding filament mechanism combined with the anaphase B-specific inhibition of a kinesin-13 MT depolymerase on spindle poles. Such conserved features allow predictions of force-velocity characteristics and activation-deactivation profiles of key mitotic motors. Identified differences among the six predicted strategies regarding the mechanisms of prometaphase and anaphase spindle elongation suggest future experiments. {\textcopyright} 2008 EMBO and Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Accurate and comprehensive annotation of genomic sequences underpins advances in managing plant disease. However, important plant pathogens still have incomplete and inconsistent gene sets and lack dedicated funding or teams to improve this annotation. This paper describes a collaborative approach to gene curation to address this shortcoming. In the first instance, over 40 members of the Botrytis cinerea community from eight countries, with training and infrastructural support from Ensembl Fungi, used the gene editing tool Apollo to systematically review the entire gene set (11,707 protein coding genes) in 6–7 months. This has subsequently been checked and disseminated. Following this, a similar project for another pathogen, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, also led to a completely redefined gene set. Currently, we are working with the Zymoseptoria tritici community to enable them to achieve the same. While the tangible outcome of these projects is improved gene sets, it is apparent that the inherent agreement and ownership of a single gene set by research teams as they undergo this curation process are consequential to the acceleration of research in the field. With the generation of large data sets increasingly affordable, there is value in unifying both the divergent data sets and their associated research teams, pooling time, expertise, and resources. Community-driven annotation efforts can pave the way for a new kind of collaboration among pathogen research communities to generate well-annotated reference data sets, beneficial not just for the genome being examined but for related species and the refinement of automatic gene prediction tools.},

abstract = {Accurate chromosome segregation during mitotic division of budding yeast depends on the multiprotein kinetochore complex, Dam1 (also known as DASH). Purified Dam1 heterodecamers encircle microtubules (MTs) to form rings that can function as "couplers," molecular devices that transduce energy from MT disassembly into the motion of a cargo. Here we show that MT depolymerization develops a force against a Dam1 ring that is sixfold larger than the force exerted on a coupler that binds only one side of an MT. Wild-type rings slow depolymerization fourfold, but rings that include a mutant Dam1p with truncated C terminus slow depolymerization less, consistent with the idea that this tail is part of a strong bond between rings and MTs. A molecular-mechanical model for Dam1-MT interaction predicts that binding between this flexible tail and the MT wall should cause a Dam1 ring to wobble, and Fourier analysis of moving, ring-attached beads corroborates this prediction. Comparison of the forces generated against wild-type and mutant complexes confirms the importance of tight Dam1-MT association for processive cargo movement under load. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Objective: Predicting postoperative seizure freedom using functional correlation networks derived from interictal intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) has shown some success. However, there are important challenges to consider: (1) electrodes physically closer to each other naturally tend to be more correlated, causing a spatial bias; (2) implantation location and number of electrodes differ between patients, making cross-subject comparisons difficult; and (3) functional correlation networks can vary over time but are currently assumed to be static. Methods: In this study, we address these three challenges using intracranial EEG data from 55 patients with intractable focal epilepsy. Patients additionally underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), intraoperative computed tomography, and postoperative MRI, allowing accurate localization of electrodes and delineation of the removed tissue. Results: We show that normalizing for spatial proximity between nearby electrodes improves prediction of postsurgery seizure outcomes. Moreover, patients with more extensive electrode coverage were more likely to have their outcome predicted correctly (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve {\textgreater} 0.9, P « 0.05) but not necessarily more likely to have a better outcome. Finally, our predictions are robust regardless of the time segment analyzed. Significance: Future studies should account for the spatial proximity of electrodes in functional network construction to improve prediction of postsurgical seizure outcomes. Greater coverage of both removed and spared tissue allows for predictions with higher accuracy.},

abstract = {Follistatin (Fst) inhibits transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B) proteins and is a known regulator of amniote myogenesis. Here, we used phylogenetic, genomic and experimental approaches to study its evolution in teleosts. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that one fst gene (fst1) is common to euteleosts, but a second gene (fst2) is conserved specifically within the Ostariophysi. Zebrafish fst1/2 respectively appear on chromosomes 5 and 10 in two genomic regions, each with conserved synteny to a single region in tetrapods. Interestingly, other teleosts have two corresponding chromosomal regions with a similar repertoire of paralogues. Phylogenetic reconstruction clustered these gene duplicates into two sister clades branching from tetrapod sequences. We suggest that an ancestral fst-containing chromosome was duplicated during the teleost whole genome duplication, but that fst2 was lost in lineages external to the Ostariophysi. We show that Fst1 of teleosts/mammals has evolved under strong purifying selection, but the N-terminal of Fst2 may have evolved under positive selection. Furthermore, the tissue-specific expression of zebrafish fst2 was restricted to fewer tissues compared to its paralogue and the single fst1 orthologue of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Zebrafish fst1/2 may have subfunctionalized relative to non-duplicated vertebrate lineages, as several regions in the fst promoter of tetrapods were conserved with one paralogue, but not both. Finally, we examined the embryonic expression of fst1 in a teleost outside the Ostariophysi (Atlantic salmon). During segmentation, fst1 was expressed in the anterior somite compartment but was excluded from muscle progenitors that strongly expressed myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs). Later, fst1 was expressed in myogenic progenitors of the pectoral fin buds and also within the pax7(+) cell layer external to the myotome.},

abstract = {Acute cholesterol depletion is generally associated with decreased or abolished T cell signalling but it can also cause T cell activation. This anomaly has been addressed in Jurkat T cells using progressive cholesterol depletion with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD). At depletion levels higher than 50{\%} there is substantial cell death, which explains reports of signalling inhibition. At 10-20{\%} depletion levels, tyrosine phosphorylation is increased, ERK is activated and there is a small increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+). Peripheral actin polymerisation is also triggered by limited cholesterol depletion. Strikingly, the lipid raft marker GM1 aggregates upon cholesterol depletion and these aggregated domains concentrate the signalling proteins Lck and LAT, whereas the opposite is true for the non lipid raft marker the transferrin receptor. Using PP2, an inhibitor of Src family kinase activation, it is demonstrated that the lipid raft aggregation occurs independently of and thus upstream of the signalling response. Upon cholesterol depletion there is an increase in overall plasma membrane order, indicative of more ordered domains forming at the expense of disordered domains. That cholesterol depletion and not unspecific effects of MBCD was behind the reported results was confirmed by performing all experiments with MBCD-cholesterol, when no net cholesterol extraction took place. We conclude that non-lethal cholesterol depletion causes the aggregation of lipid rafts which then induces T cell signalling.},

In this paper, we report a dual mechanism underlying nuclear congression during fission yeast karyogamy upon mating of haploid cells. Using microfluidic chambers for long-term imaging, we captured the precise timing of nuclear congression and identified two minus end-directed motors operating in parallel in this process. Kinesin-14 Klp2 associated with MTs may cross-link and slide antiparallel MTs emanating from the two nuclei, whereas dynein accumulating at spindle pole bodies (SPBs) may pull MTs nucleated from the opposite SPB. Klp2-dependent nuclear congression proceeds at constant speed, whereas dynein accumulation results in an increase of nuclear velocity over time. Surprisingly, the light intermediate chain Dli1, but not dynactin, is required for this previously unknown function of dynein. We conclude that efficient nuclear congression depends on the cooperation of two minus end-directed motors.},

An extensive search of public databases (including both EST and genome databases) identified partial sequences predicted to encode more than three dozen new members of the MAP215Dis1 family, including putative MAP215Dis1-related proteins in Giardia lamblia and four other protists, sixteen additional species of fungi, six plants, and twelve animals.

abstract = {In anaphase spindles, antiparallel microtubules associate to form tight midzone bundles, as required for functional spindle architecture and correct chromosome segregation. Several proteins selectively bind to these overlaps to control cytokinesis. How midzone bundles assemble is poorly understood. Here, using an in vitro reconstitution approach, we demonstrate that minimal midzone bundles can reliably self-organize in solution from dynamic microtubules, the microtubule crosslinker PRC1, and the motor protein KIF4A. The length of the central antiparallel overlaps in these microtubule bundles is similar to that observed in cells and is controlled by the PRC1/KIF4A ratio. Experiments and computer simulations demonstrate that minimal midzone bundle formation results from promoting antiparallel microtubule crosslinking, stopping microtubule plus-end dynamicity, and motor-driven midzone compaction and alignment. The robustness of this process suggests that a similar self-organization mechanism may contribute to the reorganization of the spindle architecture during the metaphase to anaphase transition in cells. Hannabuss et al. identify a minimal set of proteins that can arrange microtubules in vitro into ordered antiparallel bundles, similar to the ones found in anaphase spindles. Using quantitative imaging and computer simulations, they outline a simple molecular mechanism that explains the self-organization phenomena and its robustness.},

abstract = {Many organisms divide chromosomes within the confines of the nuclear envelope (NE) in a process known as closed mitosis. Thus, they must ensure coordination between segregation of the genetic material and division of the NE itself. Although many years of work have led to a reasonably clear understanding of mitotic spindle function in chromosome segregation, the NE division mechanism remains obscure. Here, we show that fission yeast cells overexpressing the transforming acid coiled coil (TACC)-related protein, Mia1p/Alp7p, failed to separate the spindle pole bodies (SPBs) at the onset of mitosis, but could assemble acentrosomal bipolar and antiparallel spindle structures. Most of these cells arrested in anaphase with fully extended spindles and nonsegregated chromosomes. Spindle poles that lacked the SPBs did not lead the division of the NE during spindle elongation, but deformed it, trapping the chromosomes within. When the SPBs were severed by laser microsurgery in wild-type cells, we observed analogous deformations of the NE by elongating spindle remnants, resulting in NE division failure. Analysis of dis1Delta cells that elongate spindles despite unattached kinetochores indicated that the SPBs were required for maintaining nuclear shape at anaphase onset. Strikingly, when the NE was disassembled by utilizing a temperature-sensitive allele of the Ran GEF, Pim1p, the abnormal spindles induced by Mia1p overexpression were capable of segregating sister chromatids to daughter cells, suggesting that the failure to divide the NE prevents chromosome partitioning. Our results imply that the SPBs preclude deformation of the NE during spindle elongation and thus serve as specialized structures enabling nuclear division during closed mitosis in fission yeast.},

abstract = {Elongation of the mitotic spindle during anaphase B contributes to chromosome segregation in many cells. Here, we quantitatively test the ability of two models for spindle length control to describe the dynamics of anaphase B spindle elongation using experimental data from Drosophila embryos. In the slide-and-flux-or-elongate (SAFE) model, kinesin-5 motors persistently slide apart antiparallel interpolar microtubules (ipMTs). During pre-anaphase B, this outward sliding of ipMTs is balanced by depolymerization of their minus ends at the poles, producing poleward flux, while the spindle maintains a constant length. Following cyclin B degradation, ipMT depolymerization ceases so the sliding ipMTs can push the poles apart. The competing slide-and-cluster (SAC) model proposes that MTs nucleated at the equator are slid outward by the cooperative actions of the bipolar kinesin-5 and a minus-end-directed motor, which then pulls the sliding MTs inward and clusters them at the poles. In assessing both models, we assume that kinesin-5 preferentially cross-links and slides apart antiparallel MTs while the MT plus ends exhibit dynamic instability. However, in the SAC model, minus-end-directed motors bind the minus ends of MTs as cargo and transport them poleward along adjacent, parallel MT tracks, whereas in the SAFE model, all MT minus ends that reach the pole are depolymerized by kinesin-13. Remarkably, the results show that within a narrow range of MT dynamic instability parameters, both models can reproduce the steady-state length and dynamics of pre-anaphase B spindles and the rate of anaphase B spindle elongation. However, only the SAFE model reproduces the change in MT dynamics observed experimentally at anaphase B onset. Thus, although both models explain many features of anaphase B in this system, our quantitative evaluation of experimental data regarding several different aspects of spindle dynamics suggests that the SAFE model provides a better fit.},

We use quantitative fluorescent speckle microscopy to map with high resolution the spatial organization of microtubule flux in Xenopus laevis egg extract meiotic spindles. We find that the flux velocity decreases near spindle poles by ∼20{\%}. The regional variation is independent of functional kinetochores and centrosomes and is suppressed by inhibition of dynein/dynactin, kinesin-5, or both. Statistical analysis reveals that tubulin flows in two distinct velocity modes. We propose an association of these modes with two architecturally distinct yet spatially overlapping and dynamically cross-linked arrays of microtubules: focused polar microtubule arrays of a uniform polarity and slower flux velocities are interconnected by a dense barrel-like microtubule array of antiparallel polarities and faster flux velocities. {\textcopyright} 2008 Yang et al.},

Green fluorescent protein (GFP)- Kar9p localizes to a single spot at the tip of the growing bud and the mating projection. However, the cortical localization of Kar9p does not require microtubules (Miller, R.K., and M.D. Rose. 1998. J.

In both shmoos and mitotic cells, Kar9p's cortical localization was completely dependent on polymerized actin. Kar9p localization was also altered by mutations in four genes, spa2Delta, pea2Delta, bud6Delta, and bni1Delta, required for normal polarization and actin cytoskeleton functions and, of these, bni1Delta affected Kar9p localization most severely. Like kar9Delta, bni1Delta mutants exhibited nuclear positioning defects during mitosis and in shmoos. Furthermore, like kar9Delta, the bni1Delta mutant exhibited misoriented cytoplasmic microtubules in shmoos. Genetic analysis placed BNI1 in the KAR9 pathway for nuclear migration. However, analysis of kar9Delta bni1Delta double mutants suggested that Kar9p retained some function in bni1Delta mitotic cells. Unlike the polarization mutants, kar9Delta shmoos had a normal morphology and diploids budded in the correct bipolar pattern. Furthermore, Bni1p localized normally in kar9Delta. We conclude that Kar9p's function is specific for cytoplasmic microtubule orientation and that Kar9p's role in nuclear positioning is to coordinate the interactions between the actin and microtubule networks.},

abstract = {Oriented mitosis is essential during tissue morphogenesis. The Wnt/planar cell polarity (Wnt/PCP) pathway orients mitosis in a number of developmental systems, including dorsal epiblast cell divisions along the animal-vegetal (A-V) axis during zebrafish gastrulation. How Wnt signalling orients the mitotic plane is, however, unknown. Here we show that, in dorsal epiblast cells, anthrax toxin receptor 2a (Antxr2a) accumulates in a polarized cortical cap, which is aligned with the embryonic A-V axis and forecasts the division plane. Filamentous actin (F-actin) also forms an A-V polarized cap, which depends on Wnt/PCP and its effectors RhoA and Rock2. Antxr2a is recruited to the cap by interacting with actin. Antxr2a also interacts with RhoA and together they activate the diaphanous-related formin zDia2. Mechanistically, Antxr2a functions as a Wnt-dependent polarized determinant, which, through the action of RhoA and zDia2, exerts torque on the spindle to align it with the A-V axis.},

abstract = {In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the Ataxia Telangiectasia-mutated (Atm)/Atm and Rad 3 Related (Atr) homologue Rad3 is an essential regulator of the response to DNA damage and stalled replication forks. Rad3 activates the downstream kinases Chk1 and Cds1. These kinases in turn inhibit cell cycle progression by mediating Cdc2 phosphorylation. Studies in both yeast and mammalian cells suggest additional roles for Rad3 in regulating cellular responses to environmental stress. In S. pombe, cellular responses to various environmental stresses are regulated primarily through the stress-activated MAP kinase p38 homologue Sty1. An important function of Sty1 is to drive cells rapidly through mitosis by facilitating the accumulation of Cdc25. Interestingly, Sty1 is activated simultaneously with Rad3 following exposure to UV radiation or ionizing radiation (IR). Similarly, exposure to environmental stresses induces the expression of rad3(+), cds1(+) and other checkpoint regulator genes. It is currently unclear how the pathways regulated by Sty1 and Rad3 and their opposing effects on mitosis are integrated. Recent studies suggest that Sty1 and Rad3 function together to regulate the expression of several stress response genes following exposure to IR. In this review, we discuss current knowledge on the interaction of Rad3/Atm and Sty1/p38 in regulating cellular responses to environmental stress and DNA damage.},

abstract = {Systemic hyalinosis is an autosomal recessive disease that encompasses two allelic syndromes, infantile systemic hyalinosis (ISH) and juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF), which are caused by mutations in the CMG2 gene. Here we have analyzed the cellular consequences of five patient-derived point mutations in the extracellular von Willebrand domain or the transmembrane domain of the CMG2 protein. We found that four of the mutations led to retention of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), albeit through different mechanisms. Analysis of recombinant CMG2 von Willebrand factor A (vWA) domains, to which three of the mutations map, indicated that the mutations did not prevent proper folding and ligand binding, suggesting that, in vivo, slow folding, rather than misfolding, is responsible for ER retention. Our work shows that systemic hyalinosis can be qualified as a conformational disease, at least for the mutations that have been mapped to the extracellular and transmembrane domains. The long ER half-life and the ligand binding ability of the mutated von Willebrand domains suggest that treatments based on chemical chaperones could be beneficial.},

The novelty of the mean-field model (MFM) is in its explicit representation of inter-protofilament cracks, as well as in the direct incorporation of the dimer-level kinetics. Due to inclusion of both longitudinal and lateral dimer interactions, the MFM is two dimensional, in contrast to previous theoretical models of MTs. It is the first analytical model that predicts and quantifies crucial features of MT dynamics such as (i) existence of a minimal soluble tubulin concentration needed for the polymerization (with concentration represented as a function of model parameters), (ii) existence of steady-state growth and shortening phases (given with their respective velocities), and (iii) existence of an unstable pause state near zero velocity. In addition, the size of the GTP cap of a growing MT is estimated. Theoretical predictions are shown to be in good agreement with the numerical simulations. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

In these processes, forces generated at the molecular level by motor proteins are transmitted by disordered fiber networks, resulting in large-scale active stresses. Although these fiber networks are well characterized macroscopically, this stress generation by microscopic active units is not well understood. Here we theoretically study force transmission in these networks. We find that collective fiber buckling in the vicinity of a local active unit results in a rectification of stress towards strongly amplified isotropic contraction. This stress amplification is reinforced by the networks' disordered nature, but saturates for high densities of active units. Our predictions are quantitatively consistent with experiments on reconstituted tissues and actomyosin networks and shed light on the role of the network microstructure in shaping active stresses in cells and tissue.},

abstract = {Aurora-B kinases are important regulators of mitotic chromosome segregation, where they are required for the faithful bi-orientation of sister chromatids. In contrast to mitosis, sister chromatids have to be oriented toward the same spindle pole in meiosis-I, while homologous chromosomes are bi-oriented. We find that the fission yeast Aurora kinase Ark1 is required for the faithful bi-orientation of sister chromatids in mitosis and of homologous chromosomes in meiosis-I. Unexpectedly, Ark1 is also necessary for the faithful mono-orientation of sister chromatids in meiosis-I, even though the canonical mono-orientation pathway, which depends on Moa1 and Rec8, seems intact. Our data suggest that Ark1 prevents unified sister kinetochores during metaphase-I from merotelic attachment to both spindle poles and thus from being torn apart during anaphase-I, revealing a novel mechanism promoting monopolar attachment. Furthermore, our results provide an explanation for the previously enigmatic observation that fission yeast Shugoshin Sgo2, which assists in loading Aurora to centromeres, and its regulator Bub1 are required for the mono-orientation of sister chromatids in meiosis-I. {\textcopyright}2007 European Molecular Biology Organization.},

Using optical tweezers, we applied tension to a model of the kinetochore-microtubule interface composed of the yeast Dam1 complex bound to individual dynamic microtubule tips. Higher tension decreased the likelihood that growing tips would begin to shorten, slowed shortening, and increased the likelihood that shortening tips would resume growth. These effects are similar to the effects of tension on kinetochore-attached microtubule fibres in many cell types, suggesting that we have reconstituted a direct mechanism for microtubule-length control in mitosis.},

Ncd is a minus-end-directed motor protein that has an ATP-independent microtubule binding site in the tail region, which enables it to act as a dynamic crosslinker of microtubules to assemble and maintain the spindle. Although a tailless Ncd has been shown to be nonprocessive, the role of the Ncd tail in single-molecule motility is unknown. Here, we show that individual Ncd dimers containing the tail region can move processively along microtubules at very low ionic strength, which provides the first evidence of processivity for minus-end-directed kinesins. The movement of GFP-Ncd consists of both a unidirectional and a diffusive element, and it was sensitive to ionic strength. Motility of a truncation series of Ncd and removal of the tubulin tail suggested that the Ncd tail serves as an electrostatic tether to microtubules. Under higher ionic conditions, Ncd showed only a small bias in diffusion along "single" microtubules, whereas it exhibited processive movement along "bundled" microtubules. This property may allow Ncd to accumulate preferentially in the vicinity of focused microtubules and then to crosslink and slide microtubules, possibly contributing to dynamic spindle self-organization.},

Here, we show that Klp5 and Klp6 are mutually dependent on each other for nuclear mitotic localization. During interphase, they are exported to the cytoplasm. In sharp contrast, during mitosis, Klp5 and Klp6 remain in the nucleus, which requires the existence of each counterpart. Canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS) is identified in the nonkinesin C-terminal regions. Intriguingly individual NLS mutants (NLSmut) exhibit loss-of-function phenotypes, suggesting that Klp5 and Klp6 enter the nucleus separately. Indeed, although neither Klp5-NLSmut nor Klp6-NLSmut enters the nucleus, wild-type Klp6 or Klp5, respectively, does so with different kinetics. In the absence of Klp5/6, microtubule catastrophe/rescue frequency and dynamicity are suppressed, whereas growth and shrinkage rates are least affected. Remarkably, chimera strains containing only the N-terminal Klp5 kinesin domains cannot disassemble interphase microtubules during mitosis, leading to the coexistence of cytoplasmic microtubules and nuclear spindles with massive chromosome missegregation. In this strain, a marked reduction of microtubule dynamism, even higher than in klp5/6 deletions, is evident. We propose that Klp5 and Klp6 play a vital role in promoting microtubule dynamics, which is essential for the spatiotemporal control of microtubule morphogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The American Society for Cell Biology.},

However, it has not yet been analyzed how stochasticity can enrich the system's behavior, creating effects that are not observed in the deterministic case. To address this problem we use a comparative approach. We develop a reaction network for the dynamics of the lac operon genetic switch and derive corresponding deterministic and stochastic models that incorporate biological details. We then analyze the effects of key biomolecular mechanisms, such as promoter strength and binding affinities, on the behavior of the models. No assumptions or approximations are made when building the models other than those utilized in the reaction network. Thus, we are able to carry out a meaningful comparison between the predictions of the two models to demonstrate genuine effects of stochasticity. Such a comparison reveals that in the presence of stochasticity, certain biomolecular mechanisms can profoundly influence the region where the system exhibits bistability, a key characteristic of the lac operon dynamics. For these cases, the temporal asymptotic behavior of the deterministic model remains unchanged, indicating a role of stochasticity in modulating the behavior of the system. ?? 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

Residues in the spectrin domain of PRC1 contacting the MT are highly conserved and interact with the same pocket recognized by kinesin. We additionally found that PRC1 promotes MT assembly even in the presence of the MT stabilizer taxol. Interestingly, the angle of the spectrin domain on the MT surface corresponds to the previously observed cross-bridge angle between MTs cross-linked by full-length, dimeric PRC1. This finding, together with molecular dynamic simulations describing the intrinsic flexibility of PRC1, suggests that the MT-spectrin domain interface determines the geometry of the MT arrays cross-linked by PRC1.},

CLASPs are conserved MT-binding proteins implicated in the regulation of MT plus ends. Here, we show that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe CLASP, cls1p/peg1p, mediates the stabilization of overlapping MTs within the mitotic spindle and interphase bundles. cls1p localizes to these regions but not to interphase MT plus ends. Inactivation of cls1p leads to the rapid depolymerization of spindle midzone MTs. cls1p also stabilizes a subset of MTs within interphase bundles. cls1p prevents disassembly of the entire microtubule, while still allowing for plus-end growth. It has no measurable effects on MT nucleation, polymerization, catastrophe, or bundling. A direct interaction with ase1p (PRC1/MAP65) targets cls1p to regions of antiparallel MT overlap. These findings show how a MT-stabilizing factor attached to specific sites on MTs can help to generate MT structures that have both dynamic and stable components. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, the MT1-MMP-dependent activation of proMMP-2 induced by concanavalin A and cytochalasin D was correlated with the processing of MT1-MMP to its proteolytically inactive 43 kDa fragment in U-87 glioblastoma and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma tumour cell lines; this processing was also preferentially observed within the caveolar fraction. Interestingly, whereas the expression of caveolin 1 had no effect on the MT1-MMP-dependent activation of proMMP-2, its co-expression with MT1-MMP antagonized the MT1-MMP-increased migratory potential of COS-7 cells. Taken together, our results provide evidence that MT1-MMP is preferentially compartmentalized and proteolytically processed in caveolae of cancer cells. The inhibition of MT1-MMP-dependent cell migration by caveolin 1 also suggests that the localization of MT1-MMP to caveolin-enriched domains might have an important function in the control of its enzymic activity.},

abstract = {Previous work from this laboratory has indicated that very low concentrations of vinblastine block HeLa cells at mitosis in the presence of a full complement of microtubules and without major disruption of spindle organization. In the present study we analyzed the structural organization of mitotic spindle microtubules, chromosomes and centrosomes by electron microscopy after incubating HeLa cells for one cell cycle with 2 nM vinblastine. We found that mitotic block of HeLa cells by vinblastine was associated with alterations of the fine structure of the spindle that were subtle but profound in their apparent consequences. The cell cycle was blocked in a stage that resembled prometaphase or metaphase; chromosomes had not undergone anaphase segregation. Neither the structure of the microtubules nor the structure of the kinetochores was detectably altered by the drug. However, the number of microtubules attached to kinetochores was decreased significantly. In addition, the centrosomes were altered; the normal close association of mother and daughter centriole was lost, numerous membranous vesicles were found in the centrosomal region, and many centrioles exhibited abnormal ultrastructure and had microtubules coursing through their interiors. These findings are consistent with our previous results and indicate that inhibition of the polymerization dynamics of mitotic spindle microtubules and perhaps of centriole microtubules, rather than microtubule depolymerization, is responsible for the mitotic inhibition by vinblastine.},

abstract = {Cellular morphogenesis relies partly on cell polarization by the cytoskeleton. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, it is well established that microtubules (MTs) deliver the spatial cue Tea1, a kelch repeat protein, to the tip regions to direct the growth machinery at the cell tips driving the linear extension of the rod-shaped organism to maintain a straight long axis. Here, we report the characterization of Knk1 (kink), a previously unidentified member of the superfamily of ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA+), whose deletion causes a unique morphological defect characterized by the formation of kinks close to cell tips. Through genetic analysis, we place Knk1 into a novel pathway controlling cell shape independently of MTs and Tea1. Knk1 localizes at cell tips. Its localization is mediated by the Knk1 N terminus and is enhanced upon ATP binding to the C-terminal ATPase domain. Furthermore, Knk1 tip recruitment is regulated by SRC-like adaptor 2 (Sla2) and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) independently of Sla2's role in endocytosis. Finally, we discovered that Knk1 shows an anticorrelated oscillatory behavior between the two cell tips at a periodicity that is different from the reported oscillatory Cdc42 dynamics.},

abstract = {Living cells move thanks to assemblies of actin filaments and myosin motors that range from very organized striated muscle tissue to disordered intracellular bundles. The mechanisms powering these disordered structures are debated, and all models studied so far predict that they are contractile. We reexamine this prediction through a theoretical treatment of the interplay of three well-characterized internal dynamical processes in actomyosin bundles: actin treadmilling, the attachement-detachment dynamics of myosin and that of crosslinking proteins. We show that these processes enable an extensive control of the bundle's active mechanics, including reversals of the filaments' apparent velocities and the possibility of generating extension instead of contraction. These effects offer a new perspective on well-studied in vivo systems, as well as a robust criterion to experimentally elucidate the underpinnings of actomyosin activity.},

abstract = {The Aurora kinase complex, also called the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), is essential for faithful chromosome segregation and completion of cell division. In Fungi and Animalia, this complex consists of the kinase Aurora B/AIR-2/Ipl1p, INCENP/ICP-1/Sli15p, and Survivin/BIR-1/Bir1p. A fourth subunit, Borealin/Dasra/CSC-1, is required for CPC targeting to centromeres and central spindles and has only been found in Animalia. Here we identified a new core component of the CPC in budding yeast, Nbl1p. NBL1 is essential for viability and nbl1 mutations cause chromosome missegregation and lagging chromosomes. Nbl1p colocalizes and copurifies with the CPC, and it is essential for CPC localization, stability, integrity, and function. Nbl1p is related to the N-terminus of Borealin/Dasra/CSC-1 and is similarly involved in connecting the other CPC subunits. Distant homology searching identified nearly 200, mostly unannotated, Borealin/Dasra/CSC-1–related proteins from nearly 150 species within Fungi and Animalia. Analysis of the sequence of these proteins, combined with comparative protein structure modeling of Bir1p-Nbl1p-Sli15p using the crystal structure of the human Survivin–Borealin–INCENP complex, revealed a striking structural conservation across a broad range of species. Our biological and computational analyses therefore establish that the fundamental design of the CPC is conserved from Fungi to Animalia.},

abstract = {Accurate chromosome segregation is necessary to ensure genomic integrity. Segregation depends on the proper functioning of the centromere, kinetochore, and mitotic spindle microtubules and is monitored by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, defects in Dis1, a microtubule-associated protein that influences microtubule dynamics, lead to mitotic arrest as a result of an active SAC and consequent failure to grow at low temperature. In a mutant dis1 background (dis1-288), loss of function of Msc1, a fission yeast homolog of the KDM5 family of proteins, suppresses the growth defect and promotes normal mitosis. Genetic analysis implicates a histone deacetylase (HDAC)–linked pathway in suppression because HDAC mutants clr6-1, clr3D, and sir2D, though not hos2D, also promote normal mitosis in the dis1-288 mutant. Suppression of the dis phenotype through loss of msc1 function requires the spindle checkpoint protein Mad2 and is limited by the presence of the heterochromatin-associated HP1 protein homolog Swi6. We speculate that alterations in histone acetylation promote a centromeric chromatin environment that compensates for compromised dis1 function by allowing for successful kinetochore-microtubule interactions that can satisfy the SAC. In cells arrested in mitosis by mutation of dis1, loss of function of epigenetic determinants such as Msc1 or specific HDACs can promote cell survival. Because the KDM5 family of proteins has been implicated in human cancers, an appreciation of the potential role of this family of proteins in chromosome segregation is warranted.},

abstract = {To position the mitotic spindle, cytoskeletal components must be coordinated to generate cortical forces on astral microtubules. Although the dynein motor is common to many spindle orientation systems, 'accessory pathways' are often also required. In this work, we identified an accessory spindle orientation pathway in Drosophila that functions with Dynein during planar cell polarity, downstream of the Frizzled (Fz) effector Dishevelled (Dsh). Dsh contains a PDZ ligand and a Dynein-recruiting DEP domain that are both required for spindle orientation. The Dsh PDZ ligand recruits Canoe/Afadin and ultimately leads to Rho GTPase signaling mediated through RhoGEF2. The formin Diaphanous (Dia) functions as the Rho effector in this pathway, inducing F-actin enrichment at sites of cortical Dsh. Chimeric protein experiments show that the Dia-actin accessory pathway can be replaced by an independent kinesin (Khc73) accessory pathway for Dsh-mediated spindle orientation. Our results define two 'modular' spindle orientation pathways and show an essential role for actin regulation in Dsh-mediated spindle orientation.},

To demonstrate its application we first duplicated the promoter of the FAR1 gene in yeast and simultaneously inserted a GFP downstream of it. This created a reporter for promoter activity while leaving the FAR1 gene fully intact. In another experiment, we used PCR duplication to increase the dosage of a gene in a discrete manner, from 16 to 2x. Using TUB4, the gene encoding for the yeast c-tubulin, we validated that this led to corresponding increases in the levels of mRNA and protein. PCR duplication is an easy one-step procedure that can be adapted in different ways to permit rapid, disturbance-free investigation of various genomic regulatory elements without the need for ex vivo cloning.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized histologically by deposition of hyaline material and clinically by multiple skin lesions. Clarification of the molecular and structural changes involved in JHF skin lesions may unravel targets for pharmacotherapy.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the expression of glycosaminoglycans and their metabolizing enzymes in lesional as compared with lesion-free skin tissue specimens in JHF.

METHODS: Glycosaminoglycans were isolated, purified, and fractionated by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate membranes and agarose gels. Hyaluronic acid (HA) was quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the expression of HA metabolizing enzymes was investigated using reverse transcriptase-polypeptide chain reaction.

RESULTS: JHF lesions exhibited significantly less HA and elevated amounts of dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, whereas gene expression of HA synthase-1 and HA synthase-3 was significantly down-regulated, as compared with lesion-free skin tissue specimens.

LIMITATIONS: Because JHF is a rare disease, a limitation to our study was that we collected skin tissue specimens from only one patient.

CONCLUSION: The significant alterations of HA homeostasis in JHF lesions provide further understanding of JHF pathogenesis and may offer a target for pharmacologic intervention to treat the skin lesions associated with JHF.},

In HeLa cells, both CLASPs concentrate on the distal MT ends in a narrow region at the cell margin. CLASPs stabilize MTs by promoting pauses and restricting MT growth and shortening episodes to this peripheral cell region. We demonstrate that the middle part of CLASPs binds directly to EB1 and to MTs. Furthermore, we show that the association of CLASP2 with the cell cortex is MT independent and relies on its COOH-terminal domain. Both EB1- and cortex-binding domains of CLASP are required to promote MT stability. We propose that CLASPs can mediate interactions between MT plus ends and the cell cortex and act as local rescue factors, possibly through forming a complex with EB1 at MT tips.},

A prominent example is the anaphase spindle, where stable antiparallel bundles exist alongside dynamic microtubules and provide spatial cues for cytokinesis. How are dynamics of spatially proximal arrays differentially regulated? We reconstitute a minimal system of three midzone proteins: the microtubule-cross-linker PRC1, and its interactors CLASP1 and Kif4A, proteins that promote and suppress microtubule elongation, respectively. We find their collective activity promotes elongation of single microtubules, while simultaneously stalling polymerization of cross-linked bundles. This striking differentiation arises from (i) higher activity of CLASP1 despite lower microtubule occupancy than Kif4A, (ii) amplification of Kif4A activity on microtubule bundles through stronger PRC1-affinity. In contrast to canonical mechanisms where antagonistic regulators set microtubule lengths of single arrays, our findings illuminate design principles by which their collective activity instead creates microenvironments comprised of arrays with distinct dynamic properties.},

The bipolar structures that form consist of antiparallel fluxing MTs, but spindle pole formation requires the addition of a NuMA-like minus-end cross-linker and directed transport of MT depolymerization activity toward minus ends. Dynamic instability and minus-end depolymerization generate realistic MT lifetimes and a truncated exponential MT length distribution.
